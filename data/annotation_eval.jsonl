So while there were some loud, dirty guitars at the 2015 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony in Cleveland on Saturday night, there was as much recognition for rock's antecedents in soul and blues, speaking less to a particular taxonomy than a spirit that's beyond words. It's easy to talk of such spirit when Paul McCartney is there to honor Ringo Starr, and Yoko Ono is on hand as well. Speaking briefly backstage, Ono expressed feeling that it was wonderful for Starr to be honored, \"just sad John and George aren't here,\" referring to her late husband John Lennon and Beatles guitarist and fellow songwriter George Harrison. Starr was certainly happy to be there \u2014 after a long wait, he's the final Beatle to be inducted as a solo act. \"I've finally been invited, and I love it,\" said the 74-year-old drummer. \"I got lucky, and it was actually in Cleveland,\" he said to enormous applause. Fifty-one years earlier, Starr had been in town to play the very same Hall; he admitted backstage that he didn't remember the cops stopping the show during \"All My Loving\" and making the Beatles return to the dressing room for ten minutes until the fans could be calmed. Starr said in a backstage interview that he couldn't recall the incident specifically, but admitted that there had been a lot of shows in between. \"I'll remember this one,\" he promised. Others receiving Rock Hall honors included Paul Butterfield Blues Band, early soul act The 5 Royales, singer Bill Withers, punk rockers Green Day, Lou Reed, Joan Jett & the Blackhearts and Stevie Ray Vaughan. It was a night for the young to honor the old and perhaps prepare for a later visit. John Mayer hailed his longtime idol, the late Vaughan, in a heartfelt speech. John Legend came out to honor Bill Withers with a performance of \"Use Me\" backed by Stevie Wonder, who inducted Withers. The two then shared \"Lean on Me,\" until Legend went and pulled Withers to the front of the stage to join them. Beck, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Bill Withers, Seymour Stein hit Rock Hall's weekend festivities . The 76-year old soul legend hasn't performed live in many years but had hinted in the months leading up to the induction ceremonies that he might sing once more. Withers sounded great, though he may have an even brighter future in stand-up. \"This has got to be the biggest AA meeting [in the] Western hemisphere,\" said Withers, alluding to an earlier moment in the show when Jimmie Vaughan confessed, \"I taught my brother guitar, and he taught me how to get sober.\" He called being inducted by Wonder, \"A lion holding the door for a kitty cat.\" The moment of relative levity was welcome after moving tributes paid to the late Lou Reed by Patti Smith and Reed's widow, music artist Laurie Anderson, who shared the three rules for life that they came up with: \"One: don't be afraid of anyone; Two: get a really good b------t detector and learn how to use it; Three: be really, really tender.\" Smith had to push back tears on at least three occasions. She recalled a night when they wound up in the same hotel and Reed invited her up. She found him in the tub dressed in black and she sat on the toilet and talked with him. Green Day was inducted by Fall Out Boy, who referenced the length of some of the speeches. Cracked Fall Out Boy frontman Patrick Stump: \"I feel like I'm in a line at the DMV.\" As one of the youngest acts, it's not surprising they gave one of the two most exciting performances of the evening. Rock Hall induction ceremony: Lou Reed 'would be amused,' says sister . The other belonged to Tom Morello, Doyle Bramhall II and Zac Brown with harmonica player Jason Ricci performing \"Born in Chicago\" in tribute to the Paul Butterfield Blues Band. Not only did Ricci slay, but Morello played a nasty scabrous solo that raised the hairs on your arm, it was so alive. Miley Cyrus inducted Joan Jett in her own inimitable way, recalling a time she walked in on Jett smoking pot and being so turned on by her strength, wisdom and soul that the young pop star wanted to have sex with the legendary rocker. Jett joined the Blackhearts and Foo Fighters' Dave Grohl for a mini-set that include such classics as \"Bad Reputation,\" the Runaways' \"Cherry Bomb\" and \"Crimson and Clover,\" the Tommy James & the Shondelles cover that Jett took to No. 1. It was that kind of a night, and it closed with a rousing version of the Beatles' \"I Want to Be Your Man,\" where just about everybody who could make it out on stage did, including a near-end guitar scrum/lead-off between Gary Clark Jr., Morello, Zac Brown and Yeah Yeah Yeahs' Nick Zinner. \u00a92015 Billboard.

{"id": "blog_28", "src": "Mood: Excited :-D  Y\u00e1. Se acab\u00f3. My study abroad grades are FINALLY processed!!! No, I'm serious this time. I have a new degree audit and everything. After being shuffled around between 3 departments all over campus for over a year, my grades from Cuba have at long last been processed into their proper place for my degree requirements. Liberal Arts had to do a few over-rides, but in the end I was shocked at how amazingly simple it was to fix this mess. Took about 20 minutes. Why the heck didn't Liberal Arts do this earlier?! I've been there God knows how many times, and they would just send me back to study abroad, or to Latin American Studies, who would then send me back to Liberal Arts, back to study abroad, ect ect ect. I felt like UT was playing ping-pong with me.  Heather, who does credit processing over at study abroad, had to call the Dean's office and speak with the person responsible for issuing degrees. She did that last week, but had to put her foot down again today and call the office again and DEMAND that someone rectify this situation ASAP--there have been people who didn't graduate on time as a result of this bureaucratic bs. I was determined not to be one of those people.  I don't think there has been ANYONE who has had to deal with more bureaucratic red tape as I have in college. Try me. Try having one of your study abroad grades lost, stuck in the Atlantic for a year. Try having 3 departments fighting over whether or not you get credit for those study abroad courses. Try having the GRE people lose your application and money. Try having the Services for Students with Disabilities demand that you have your psychiatrist re-write a letter verifying your disability. 3 times. Try running around campus getting Fulbright signatures at the last minute, with professors in 3 different departments, when they told you in the beginning it wasn't necessary. Try arguing with Latin American Studies that it's stupid to require that the 1st reader of your honors undergraduate thesis be in the department of your 'concentration', regardless of what you're actually writing about. Try having UT fail to inform you until the last minute that you can't be enrolled at ACC the semester that you plan to graduate, despite the fact that every advisor and their dog in Liberal Arts knew that you still needed to finish the ACC science credits your last semester. Try running between Liberal Arts and the Rio Grande campus at ACC, b/c in order for ACC to release a 'request form for an early grade release', they need a letter from Liberal Arts verifying that I am indeed graduating in December. Try having all this happen in one semester, when you're trying to graduate, taking 15 hours, a thesis class, and a correspondence course. Did I mention I should have died Sunday in a car accident, but didn't?  The next person who comes up to me and tells me that they are stressed is going to get an earful from me.  But.

{"id": "blog_17", "src": "The other day,  urlLink Scarlett Ace  suggested that I write reviews of books I've read, just because I've read so many. I love reading.  I'm that sort of person who will forego sleep in order to finish a particularly compelling book. But I decided to instead make my first review of a movie, partially because I don't feel like writing about the latest book I read ( Diary of a Manhattan Call Girl , if you're interested), and also have  lots  to say about the latest movie I saw. Plus, this way I'm not continually writing about little white dogs, or about how I live to annoy crankypants. (I haven't yet shared the treefrog story, it is the best ever. Some day, when I'm out of things to write. Like tomorrow.)  As deduced from the title of this post, I saw  urlLink  The Prince and Me  , starring Julia Stiles and one very hot Brit, Luke Mably. (Incidentally, he is my new love. It definitely helped that he was royalty in the movie. But even so, sooo cute. And he's older than me, which is nice because then I don't feel like I'm robbing the cradle. But enough of this. Let me get back to movie-reviewing.) Note: If you don't want to find out what happens, don't read on. I've already warned you.   The premise is very simple. Studious Girl meets Playboy Prince in Diguise. After some initial resistance on her part, they fall in love. Then she finds out he's really a prince, gets mad, but follows him anyway to Denmark. She realises that she can't be Queen of Denmark, returns home. He shows up and wins her back.  To elaborate: Girl is way into studying and wants to be a doctor and work for Doctors without Borders. She has never left Wisconsin, but has big dreams for the future. Prince, enticed by seeing an ad for  Girls Gone Wild  - the Wisconsin edition, decides that he wants to go to the midwest. He is followed by his ever faithful manservant. The manservant is great and hysterical throughout the movie. Prince meets Girl in bar, attempts to convince her to show him her boobs. Not an auspicious start - but oh, don't you already know that it's going to be true love?   Of course they fall in love. While at her family's dairy farm over Thanksgiving, there is a hysterical scene involving racing lawnmowers. Crankypants assures me that such ridiculous things do happen in rural Wisconsin. People race lawnmowers! I so want to see this when I'm out there. There is also the requisite shot of someone wearing a cheesehead hat. Then the tabloids catch up to the hot prince, and he's called home to Denmark where he's to assume responsibility for the throne as his father is sick. Initially mad at his deception, Girl realises that she does love the Prince, and hightails it to Copenhagen. Blahblahblah, I'm tired of recapping the film, this isn't fun. Suffice it to say that he proposes, she accepts but later realises that she really does want to be a doctor. (Why? It's so overrated.) She returns home and at her graduation a year later, he shows up, saying that he loves her and only her and will let her pursue her dreams and he will wait as long as it takes, because he loves her  that  much. TadaaalotsofkissingTheEnd!   But before you write this off as another stupid teen movie - which it is, I agree - it does have some redeeming qualities, that makes it perfect for females of any age. (Guys, you're out of luck, unless you think Julia Stiles is hot.) Let's go over the romantic moments in the movie, that make you melt inside, coo, and wish that men were like this in real life.  To apologise for his boorish behaviour at the bar (where he attempts to get her to show her boobs), Prince quotes from  Romeo and Juliet . Shakespeare. He uses Shakespeare to say 'I'm sorry.' I'm lucky if crankypants even realises that I'm miffed at him. But the prince - Shakespeare - definitely 5 'aws' on the 'Aw that's so cute and sweet' scale.    He gets a job at the bar she works at in order to make money. Late one night, they're closing up and she plays a song on the jukebox, and dances barefoot around the empty tables. This made me wince because ew, there are like all sorts of germs on a dirty barfloor, but this is a movie. The prince just stands there, watching her, madly in love. At least like 3 'aws'.   While they're studying at the library, he plays with her fingers. This may seem insignificant and silly, but believe me, it's big. It's the little things that matters. I wish guys would realise this. Definitely 2 'aws'.   When she flies to Denmark to pursue him, she sees him in a royal procession. That's right, he's all done up in royal riding wear with lots of medallions and gold cording and a silly hat, and he's on a horse. When he sees her, there's this gigantic smile on his face, and he breaks form, gallops around and swings her upon his horse. I agree, this cannot be accomplished by the common person. Which makes it even better. It gets at least like 40 'aws'.    Later that same day, and still in his royal riding wear, he proposes to her. And boy, does he propose. Down on one knee, he tells her how much he loves her, and then opens his hand - and there's a butterfly, atop this gigantic diamond ring, and the butterfly flitters away. It was poetic. It was beautiful. It melted me into a puddle of mush from which I will never recover. There is no way to rank this scene. The butterfly. See, it's in the little things.    At his coronation ball, he asks her to dance, saying that they're playing their song. Surprised, she asks if they even have a song - then realises that the orchestra is playing that same song that played on the jukebox when he once watched her so longingly. This gets 20 'aws'.   At the same ball, he pulls her into a dark room and says he has a surprise for her. No, not  that  kind of surprise, get your mind out of the gutter. In the corner, there is a covered table, and with a tada takes the tablecloth off to reveal a - dumdadum - meat slicer! Okay, not obviously cute. But see, earlier in the movie, the first time they connect is when she shows him how to use the meat slicer at the bar where he's just started working. So see now, it's cute. Meaningful only to the two of them. And he makes her a turkey sandwich. This receives 20 'aws' too, it's hard to say if this is cuter or if the 'this is our song' scene is.  There are a few other cute scenes, but I'm not going to reveal them because you really should watch the movie yourself. If only men would realise how easy it is to make a girl completely fall in love with them. Really, there should be some sort of course that men can be forcibly enrolled in, with courses entitled 'How to woo a girl without losing your masculinity' and 'The proper proposal' and 'It's all in the little things: How to keep a girl in love with you.' Movies such as this one would obviously be required viewing.", "annotations": [{"summary_1": "Scarlett Ace suggested that I write reviews of books, but I decided to make my first review of a movie.

{"id": "cnndm_057854bbbc888a8607afd8a699533efc14d34be6", "src": "Washington (CNN)Until recently, if you sat in church on Sunday mornings, pollsters could predict where you stood on same-sex marriage. What a difference a decade makes. In 2003, when the Massachusetts Supreme Court became the country's first to legalize same-sex marriage, less than 30% of religiously affiliated Americans supported gays' and lesbians' right to wed. By 2014, that number had climbed to 47%, according to a survey conducted by the Public Religion Research Institute. That's more than the 45% who said they opposed same-sex nuptials. The margin is small but statistically significant, said Robert P. Jones, CEO of PRRI, because of the exceptionally large pool of respondents: 40,000 adult Americans. (Eight percent refused to answer or said they didn't know their stance on same-sex marriage.) According to PRRI's poll, there are now more people of faith who favor marriage equality than stand against it, a dramatic turn in one of this country's most divisive debates and a generational shift with the potential to sweep through everything from the wedding industry to the 2016 presidential race. \"There's been a huge swing in the last decade,\" said Jones. \"There are now big, mainstream groups on both sides of the debate.\" If the U.S. Supreme Court has been paying attention, it likely saw this trend coming. Each time the high court has considered a case related to same-sex marriage, the pile of amicus briefs from religious groups supporting gay rights has inched a little taller, and the crowds protesting outside their grand marble steps has gradually grown more diverse. On Tuesday, for example, as the Supreme Court hears oral arguments in Obergefell v. Hodges, a case widely expected to produce a landmark ruling on same-sex marriage, an interfaith coalition of clergy led by the dean of Washington's National Cathedral is planning to march in support of LGBT rights. \"I join with many across the spectrum of American faith communities in my hope that the Court's ruling will permit same-sex marriage in all 50 states,\" the Very Rev. Gary Hall, the cathedral's dean, said in a statement. \"I trust that their judgment will end discrimination against those who seek God's blessing on their marriages.\" Clergy from Hall's religious denomination, the Episcopal Church, have also submitted an amicus brief in support of same-sex marriage. The brief is endorsed by nearly 2,000 faith leaders, including rabbis, Methodist ministers, Lutheran bishops, seminary professors and Congregationalist chaplains. Another brief, submitted by the Anti-Defamation League, is signed by Jewish, Hindu and Presbyterian groups. In a reverse of traditional arguments against gay marriage, some members of these groups say their religious rights will be curtailed if states do not allow them to perform same-sex nuptials. Prominent and powerful religious groups are lined up on the other side as well, including the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, National Association of Evangelicals, Southern Baptist Convention, Assemblies of God and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, also known as the Mormon church. Together, leaders of these faiths represent more than 120 million Americans. But as PRRI's survey shows, there are often differences of opinion between the pulpits and the pews. Despite vocal opposition from the U.S. Catholic Bishops, for example, 60% of Catholics now favor same-sex marriage. That's a huge increase from 2003, when just 35% backed gay rights, according to survey conducted at the time by the Pew Research Center. Mainline Protestants -- so-called for their prominence in 20th century American life -- also saw a huge shift in the last decade. While 36% supported same-sex marriage in 2003, now 62% do. At a glance, the pro-gay marriage faction is now strikingly diverse, encompassing Buddhists, Catholics, Jews and Hindus. But the pro-traditional marriage crowd is just as motley, bridging black Protestants, Mormons, Muslims and white evangelicals, according to PRRI's survey. Same-sex marriage rights worldwide . Legalized nationwide:Argentina, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Iceland, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, South Africa, Sweden . Legalized in certain regions:Brazil, Mexico, United States . Civil unions or domestic partnerships:Andorra, Austria, Brazil, Colombia, Czech Republic, Ecuador, Finland, France, Germany, Greenland, Hungary, Ireland, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Slovenia, Switzerland, United Kingdom, Uruguay and parts of Australia, Mexico, United States and Venezuela . The survey data comes from PRRI's American Values Atlas, conducted between April and December of last year. PRRI is a nonpartisan, nonprofit research group that focuses on faith and American culture. Separate surveys conducted by PRRI and other groups show much of the newfound religious support for same-sex marriage is coming from younger Americans. Seven in 10 Millennials, for example, support same-sex marriage and say that faith groups alienate young adults by being judgemental on sexual ethics. Half of millennial Republicans say gays and lesbians should be allowed to marry, and 43% of white evangelical millennials agree. Those numbers could put GOP presidential candidates in a tight spot, said Jones, as they try to expand their base and appeal to younger Americans. \"The real challenge for GOP candidates is how can they plant their feet deftly enough not to offend older conservatives in the primaries but still be able to pivot in the general election to a younger generation,\" Jones said. Politicians may pivot on same-sex marriage, but Bible-believing Christians should not -- even if public opinion turns against them, said Denny Burk, a professor at Boyce College, a Southern Baptist school in Louisville, Kentucky. \"For me, the number of people who come to the message is not the main issue. There are periods when the Gospel is popular and periods when it's not. You can't base your evaluation of its truthfulness on its popularity at a given historical moment.\" Still, Burk said he doesn't doubt that more millennials accept same-sex marriage, and he fully expects the Supreme Court to legalize gay weddings countrywide this June when the justices render a decision in Obergefell v. Hodges. But the fight is far from over, Burk said. \"Just like we've seen this decades-long culture war with abortion, we're going to see the same thing with gay marriage.\"", "annotations": [{"summary_1": "A new survey shows a shift in attitudes toward same-sex marriage.

{"id": "blog_19", "src": "Right in my own proverbial backyard, we had 8 of the 9 remaining candidates for the Democratic nomination appearing at a Rock the Vote forum/debate at Fanuial Hall.  I missed the debate, both in person and on TV, but have been checking on the stories to find out what the deal with Howard Dean's  urlLink confederate flag comments  were.  Now understanding the context, I have to say that I do think Edwards and Sharpton were wrong to attack him for it BUT that Dean did an  urlLink embarassingly bad job  defending himself.  If you're going to take the route of a defiant defense, you should be able to put up a good one, and Dean didn't.  The shame is, he did have a good point, but even I didn't get it until his last remark.  And his initial comment didn't provide ANY of the context which made the remark a statement in support of racial diversity rather than pandering to racial tension.  The other thing I noted in the candid photographs of the event is how all of the candidates were clearly getting along, inspite of the bickering that went on in the debate.  That is a powerful image that the Democratic Party NEEDS to use.  Primarily elections need to be divisive, but we also need to show a unified front.  I trust that is the belief of everyone in the race (though I have concerns about Sharpton due to past behavior, and Kucinich due to current remarks) and this needs to be stressed.  The primaries are important, but do not show a lack of resolve on the part of Democrats.  It better not, anyway.  Any progressive who tries to claim there is no difference between a Democrat and George W. is going to look like a damn idiot now.  They did back in 2000, mind you, but Nader was able to sway enough people with his false advertising.  We mustn't let this happen again.  The other big issue, of course, is what they were wearing.  To appeal to young voters, the candidates went casual to varying degrees.  Mosley Braun, um, well she looked normal.  So did Lieberman and Sharpton who came in wearing jackets which they both shed for the forum.  Which actually left Sharpton looking kinda silly since his was a three-piece suit and he kept on an unbuttoned vest.  Meanwhile, John Kerry lost a jacket, but he was already tie-less.  Dean had no jacket, it seems, but he did have his sleeves rolled in a manner even I (a compulsive sleeve roller-upper) found goofy.  And finally we had the turtleneck twins, Clark and Kucinich who just seemed out of place.  Clark had on a black suit with a black turtleneck, which was really forboding on camera.  I think Kucinich did the same, but lets face it, he will never look forboding.  Other then that, I have no idea what happened.  Eh, I'll find out tomorrow on  The Daily Show.   I really need to pick a horse soon, though.  I was really high on Kerry, but I'm still quite open to Clark and Edwards.

{"id": "blog_23", "src": "There's an interesting post over at  urlLink En Banc  about law review articles, building off of a post over at  urlLink The Volokh Conspiracy .  The post basically replies to a hypothetical professor's question about what to do when top journals reject his or her work, and seeks explanations.    One of the reasons I'm linking to En Banc is that it's a new group law blog, made up of 8 people who've also got weblogs of their own.  As you'll see if you check it out, I'm one of the eight, and mostly just feel pleased to have been asked to take part, and since I basically say no to nothing....  It won't affect anything that happens here (it would be awfully dumb for me to let it, I think) -- En Banc's focused much more on 'real' legal issues, and serious stuff like that, stuff that I'd have no context (or inspiration, really) to post normally, but given the group nature of the blog, someone else's posts may occasionally spark something in me, and that gives me a place to respond.  This remains what it is -- that's just some other stuff if I'm so inspired.  It may become more trouble than it's worth, but it may also turn out cool.  I don't know.  Just an experiment.  I was actually thinking about posting anonymously over there, but that really seemed like more trouble than it's worth.  And I'll flag anything good from there over here.    Like this law review discussion, which I thought was interesting enough that I'd link.  My take on legal journals and how they work, at least at Harvard?  My 'Law Review Helga' replies to a post by 'Law Review Sally' that tells Professor 'Seattle' that maybe her article just wasn't good enough and that's why it got rejected by the journals:  'Seattle, don't listen to Sally. I'm sure your article was great. But let's face it. These journals are run by law students. Law students who barely do the reading they have to do for class, let alone the extra reading they volunteer to do so they can add 'submissions committee' to their resumes. The kid who read your article read it in eight minutes while watching South Park, and besides that is just a 2L who's never taken a class in the subject you wrote about and can't tell the difference between a groundbreaking legal article on the topic and a USA Today feature story on how many stars there are on the US flag. So it's not your fault, Seattle. It's the system. If you want to get published by today's youth running these journals (don't ask Law Review Helga her age... but she was Rutherford Hayes' kindergarten teacher, so she's been around a while), you need lewd pictures and four-letter words. That's the ticket, Seattle. Don't lose hope.'  In all seriousness, I'm on the 'submissions committee' of the journal I'm on here (which really just means I've read an article or three and written up a brief report, thumbs-up or thumbs-down -- I'm sure on the Law Review it's much more intense). And most of the articles I've read, to be honest, are simply beyond my understanding. I don't know that much law, I don't know what's 'groundbreaking' in any particular field... I'm just guessing. I'm trying -- but heck if I know what makes an article publishable in a top journal in the field. I mean, I can say if something's readable, clear, well-written... but new and noteworthy? So I don't know that I really understand the student-in-control system... or if in the end it really works, or it doesn't... but yeah, Seattle's article may be junk, but it also may just be it fell into the wrong hands over at the journal.  And actually I just had a 3-hour 'mass subcite' tonight, which, even when you're an 'article editor' and theoretically 'running' the subcite, still isn't all that much fun.  :)", "annotations": [{"summary_1": "A post on En Banc about law review articles is interesting.

{"id": "blog_2", "src": "I guess it is time to cut the crap and just get personal here.  I prefer to keep this blog towards the lighter end - funny stories about my kids or life in these united states.  But today.  Damn.  It's a very long story which I should back up and tell, but where I'm at today is where I'll begin.  I took a new job about 2 months ago.  I knew about the job from a friend of mine who used to be my doctor.  He hasn't been my doctor for a couple of years and I've known him about 10 years.  Our friendship hasn't violated any ethical code that I can think of.  Not that I haven't wanted it to.  I think it is fairly common to fall in love with your doctor - they shown concern for your well-being during times when you aren't at your best and it is easy to translate that concern into more than it really is.  Florence Nightengale effect or something like that.    His company was looking for someone with my background and I did interview with their CPA firm and out of a huge pile of candidates, I was their top pick.  (actually all of this happened last Fall and I was offered the job and turned it down - but in February the guy who took the job gave his notice so they let me know and this time I accepted it)  I moved back to the area for this job - and to work for my doctor friend who I'm half in love with.  And he knows that.  No secrets with me.    Every Friday I meet with him and my immediate boss (my doctor friend is the president of the company, my boss is the CEO of the company).  We meet at a bar downtown and discuss how things are going financially and otherwise.  Today my boss was out of town and we weren't going to have the meeting, but I convinced my friend (we'll call him hda) to meet anyway.  Honest and truly I wanted to discuss company business.  But you all know I was hoping for more.  Oh my hda is not a cad.  He's married with kids and while not happily married, committed to it.  The kicker I found out today is that his wife has been reading all the emails I've been sending him for almost a year.  I guess because he was my doctor and I knew from that relationship everything I said was confidential I just assumed that being his friend outside that environment, that would remain the same.  I've told him things that no one knows about me.  Not even my boyfriend of nine years (and right - I'm half in love with hda and have a boyfriend, is that tacky or what....) knows everything that hda knows.  AND HIS WIFE.  He acted like he kept no secrets and she knew his passwords and if she read them, she read them.  I felt like you might if you were in the shower and someone you didn't know ripped back the shower curtain and looked at you naked.    And I said 'what about your work email?' and he shrugged and said no password - he just trusted people to respect his privacy.  WHAT? HUH? WHAT?  What color is the sky on the planet he's on?  I just felt like saying 'so, you're saying that it is possible your entire office staff knows all about me, my personal life, my feelings for you, etc. etc.???'  I was aghast and I still am.  It is this nugget that has me in a state of shock at the moment.  Perhaps it seems small to you.  I am stunned.  I really don't want an affair with him, but I'm crazy about him.  You know how it is to want something and not want it at the same time.  I often think of that scene in 'Pretty Woman' when Julia Roberts' character says 'I want it all.  I want the fairy tale.'  That's what I want - but a fairy tale doesn't include affairs or divorce or any of those nasty things.  I want what isn't even possible.  I should walk away from it all, but I don't want to.  And the job.  I love the job.  It is the first job I've ever had that I really liked and liked who I worked with and for.  Last night was the board meeting which I really hated.  But I sat at the head table between hda and ceo (we'll call my boss that).  I felt like a big dog. :)  And I drank a strawberry daiquiri to calm my nerves (which sounds like something I might be saying in an AA meeting in 10 years - 'it all started when I began drinking to calm my nerves before public speaking and before I knew it, I was out of control....').  It helped.  It reduced me to the level of a normal nervous person instead of my usual freak show event that people pay money to see - flailing, foaming at the mouth, a voice so shrill it breaks glass.  And hda and ceo back me up 100% they don't leave me hanging or allow me to look stupid.  They are really great to work for.  But since I rarely drink I could tell I was feeling a litte tipsy and I needed to pee, but that meant getting up and walking out of the room in front of all of the doctors and I thought if they saw their director of finance weaving a path to the bathroom they might lose confidence in me.  So I stayed put and prayed for a speedy ending.  So the meeting dragged on.  I really think sometimes when I pray I put ideas into God's head.  'Speed it up?  Good one, K - we'll slow it down for kicks - have fun!'  I just wish life would work out in my love life.  Everything else is falling into place.  It has never worked out for me in the pursuit of love.  Perhaps it would tear the very fabric of the space/time contiuum if everything in my life lined up in a wonderful way.  Wouldn't want the guilt of that, would I?  I don't know....watching alot of TV can help you forget about guilt. :)    I have people trying to convince me that there is someone out there for me who is single.  That may be - but it is so much work weeding through the crap.  And the guy I'm dating is not a bad guy.  But I'm reminded of the guy Meg Ryan is engaged to in 'Sleepless in Seattle.'  Nice guy.  Boring guy.  And he says something like he doesn't want to be someone she settles for.  And that's where I'm at.  I feel I've settled with my current boyfriend.  But he loves me no matter what I look like, we almost never argue - and if we do he lets me win every time.  He's not bossy or controlling.  He works really hard at pleasing me as far as sex goes.  And you know what I mean.  And I wish I was over the top for him - I really do.  No butterflies.  And I could write a grocery list in my head during sex.  He doesn't take me to another place - and maybe it is romantic crap to think he should.  And maybe hda wouldn't either.  Maybe I'm just broken.", "annotations": [{"summary_1": "I'm half in love with my doctor friend. I work for his company. I thought he would keep my emails private.

{"id": "blog_34", "src": "The final lines to 'The Day After Tomorrow'.  I just got back from one of the local cinemas with decidedly mixed feelings about the movie.    Yes, I have ruined the final dialogue (big deal, like disaster movie script can really be spoiled) and the final shot is one of a very clear computer animated photo of an Earth iced over from about 35 deg N as you the viewer pans out into space, the Earth practically blends into the ubiquitous Environmental Defense Fund picture of Earth (the one seen on bumper stickers and the mail and pamphlets that always ask for money).  It's so nice that billions die so one astronaut can make his little quip about how the worst storm (both in billions of fictitious lives lost and in terms of violations of the laws of physics) has cleansed the Earth of air pollution.  Also there's all the dialogue about how in exchange for refugee status, the expatriate states of America forgave all of third world debt.  Also there's the winner about how accommodating and nice the third world is about a bunch of 1st worlders now living for the next 1,000 years or so in their midst.    Now for the reality check, and I don't mean how this film throws the Ideal Gas Law out the window.    Supposing (chuckle) such a catastrophe could happen, the third world would not care if their debt was relieved or not.  Who cares, the creditors are all frozen, and if they survived, they have to live among the debtors now.  Also, if it did become a scuffle, remember that the last military recourse of the creditors is frozen stiff in some silo in North Dakota or Siberia.  Furthermore, if such a disaster could take place, let's remember that a depopulation by half or two-thirds (since most humans live in the Northern Hemisphere) that such ideas like debt, mechanized war, communism, capitalism, and the nation-state with its national borders may cease to exist.  All are examples of social structure and were created by and for humans, mostly as means by which humans fight over temporally and spatially limited resources (since there is a possibility of there existing unlimited resources in the universe).  Thus most ideas such as debt and economics as well as conflicts are coevolutionary responses to our conflicts over resources, which are also conflicts over discourse and meaning.  A post-disaster society would most likely create new social structures and social norms which would control access and security of resources (also the society which maintained access and security would then be in the best position to spread its ideology and vice versa as an attractive ideology can be useful for winning over the human capital necessary to access, secure, and develop the resources (natural and critical natural capital).  Hence the feedback between meaning and resources sets up the coevolutionary relationship, which is then coevolutionary with other variables (like climate for example).  For more and much more scholarly information on the linkages between economics, the physical universe, conflict, and resources - check out this  urlLink journal .  The other queasy feeling I left the theatre with was also the final scene, the one with the very clean but cold Earth was the message that seemed to say that it will require a grand and total disaster to save the Earth (and ourselves being implied) from the nastier aspects of our human existence, after which of course everything will be nice.  Even meteorologically, this somewhat silly utopian metaphor works, for after a cold front moves through (with it attendant thunderstorms, rain, and occassional  urlLink natural special affects ) the post-rain air always feels so Canada-fresh and clean and the sunlight pokes through on landscapes so beyond the possibility of rendering by computer graphics that we might notice how beautiful normalcy is if we bothered to look out the damn window more often.  In the meantime we sit in darkened theatres watching special effects of a storm that could never occur while all too slowly destroying much of what we take for granted, not out of malice as some would assert, but out of ignorance as we all are in some part.  In the meantime, get away from the telescreen and spend more time outside, you'll learn to appreciate your environment that way more than any bad movie, pamphlet, or protest message would.  Also, time spent outdoors is  urlLink healthy  as well.  As for using less fossil fuels and not contributing to global warming, here's one of the latest unique  urlLink ideas .  As for the more mundane variety, even our  urlLink leading presidential candidates  for 2004 are giving it a try.  Well, that's all for now, I'll probably have more stuff to say very soon about the G-8, protests against, and my own part of it.", "annotations": [{"summary_1": "The Day After Tomorrow is a disaster movie about a nuclear war.

{"id": "blog_10", "src": "Heya!   I went to YJ today. Sneaky little cat me! At the main gate, I nearly exposed myself...I was talking about sneaking in at the walkway, when a teacher was behind me.   I had to hide in the toilet for morning assembly. HaHa. I read my Order of the Phoenix. At 8 something, I came out to check...and a man was looking at me. I was like so damn  scared. I thought he was a teacher or something. It turned out that he was a cleaner! Oh! Thank my lucky stars! WQ came to fetch me later. What a long long wait. And a sweaty one too.                              The first lecture was Maths C. Woah! The teacher is not bad wor. He's funny, he's good. We did indices rule la. Quite easy wor... He got a girlfriend, by the way. That's what he told us. Oo....  There's this short little break. I ate some cup noodles, a Tom Yam flavour one. woah! I missed this brand man! I love it!   After that, I went to WQ's classroom for GP lesson. HaHa! When I told his classmates I sneaked in, all of them went 'woah!'. HAHA! This GP teacher hor, she marked attendance. I was so damn worried of getting caught. She never asked for my name and all that....either she's idiotic or she closed one eye. Anyway, she's such a vile bitch. She's exactly like Professor Umbridge. Behind all her sweet, innocent rules are seeds of discord, to be sowed within the class. Rules like 'If one cat don't pass up homework, tha cat won't get punished. Instead, the whole class.' are exactly creating disharmony of relations between classmates! So Umbridge-gy. Idiotic. She's a Mrs. Who is so unlucky and stupid to marry her? Blind. I almost got caught to attend a class of rules and regulations. Stupid right?   After that leh, I attened Physics lecture. The Physics teacher, Mr Leong, is such a goofball. HaHa. He likes The Matrix and LOTR series. He hates the army too. Yeah. These are observations made by me. I so wu liao right? HaHa. Physics lecture not bad laos la. Quite enjoyable. :)  After that, I went to the canteen to wait for Gloria coming down for her lunch (one hour later). I cannot go to WQ's CT and MT class, because both lessons are taught by his form teacher. I cannot appear there one. I read my OotP there. Ha.  Gloria they all came down, I ate chicken rice for lunch. HaHa. I revealed that I sneaked in again, not realizing that a pair of teachers were sitting next to me. Oh well! I slept for a while, and taught Huimin some AO-Maths. Sets theory ar. Yeah. HaHa.  Soon, Janet and WQ came down. Four of us went to some coffeeshop to eat lunch. Only WQ ate there, as three of us had already eaten. After that, we went back lor.  Hmm....I called the Metro. They said no positions left for temps in Woodlands. I can try being a permanent staff la. Tomorrow I am going to the walk-in interview. HaHa. I consulted Amanda on what to say.

{"id": "cnndm_04c28c2d6c524d96e046cadf32eb44803f83a98c", "src": "Charleston, South Carolina (CNN)Police officers Saturday accompanied the hearse carrying the body of Walter Scott to his South Carolina funeral service, where hundreds of mourners celebrated his life and death as a catalyst for change in America. A pair of officers on motorcycles were part of the large procession delivering the father of four -- who was fatally shot in the back by a police officer -- to a service open to the public. An overflow crowd gathered on a humid and occasionally rainy April afternoon at W.O.R.D. Ministries Christian Center in Summerville, which has a capacity of about 300 people. The flag-draped casket of the U.S. Coast Guard veteran was wheeled inside the church as Scott's relatives and friends followed. Some dabbed tears; others embraced. Hundreds, including local officials, assembled inside the packed sanctuary -- in corridors, under an awning at the entrance, wherever they could stand. Silence filled the vast space as Scott's daughter Samantha read a poem of love dedicated to her father. Anthony Scott said God had selected his brother as a candidate for change in America. \"The change will come,\" he said, bringing to the crowd to its feet. The head of the church, George Hamilton, spoke of how Scott had brought members of his family to the church, of the agony of not only losing a family member but having to watch it happen on video. The death of Scott, who was black, at the hands of a white police officer was \"motivated by racial prejudice,\" Hamilton said. It was \"an act of overt racism.\" \"Hate came because Walter was an African-American,\" he said. Hamilton said his remarks were not meant as an indictment of law enforcement, but he singled out the officer who killed Scott as a \"disgrace to the North Charleston Police Department.\" \"There is gong to be change,\" he said. \"Walter's death will not be in vain.\" After the service, pallbearers gently lifted Scott's casket into the hearse. Crowds poured from the church. A slow-moving procession of black cars then made its way to Live Oak Memorial Gardens in Charleston for the private burial. Chris Stewart, an attorney for the Scott family, said the death represented more than an race issue. \"It's a human issue,\" he said. \"We're getting emails from people in Arkansas telling us, 'I'm a white male, and I'm supporting this family.' Their son is going to be remembered for changing the way we look at each other.\" On Friday night, Scott's open casket was draped with an American flag, and he was in a dark suit for his private visitation in Charleston. A Dallas Cowboys banner -- his favorite NFL team -- was placed outside the casket, and a figurine of a Cowboys player stood at his side. But Scott's family was missing. They needed privacy, said Charleston Mayor Joseph Riley, who attended. A week ago, Scott was killed in North Charleston after getting pulled over for a broken taillight. A passer-by caught the shooting on cell phone video, and Officer Michael Slager was swiftly charged with murder. He was fired and faces life in prison or the death penalty if convicted. Who was Walter Scott? The video shows Scott running from an officer, who fires eight shots. Scott is struck five times; he falls to the ground. \"Nothing in this video demonstrates that the officer's life or the life of another was threatened,\" National Urban League President Marc Morial said. \"The question here is whether the use of force was excessive.\" But one witness is speaking of a struggle before the shooting. And at least one expert believes a murder charge may not hold up. On Thursday, Gwen Nichols told CNN's Brian Todd that she saw Scott and Slager scuffling at the entrance to a vacant lot. \"It was like a tussle type of thing, like, you know, like, 'What do you want?' or 'What did I do?' type of thing,\" Nichols said. \"I didn't hear Mr. Slager saying 'Stop!' \" Nichols' account has similarities to Slager's. He had told investigators that he had tussled with Scott over his Taser and that he feared for his safety. A timeline of events . Criminal defense attorney Paul Callan said he believes Slager's defense will play up the reported scuffle in arguing that this is not a murder case. \"Defense attorneys will say this was a heat of passion shooting -- (that) this was something that he did suddenly after some kind of an altercation, a physical altercation with a suspect,\" Callan said. \"And that would constitute manslaughter under law, as opposed to murder, and it makes a huge difference in sentencing.\" In South Carolina, a murder conviction requires a measure of premeditation. But the account from the witness who recorded the cell phone video, Feidin Santana, paints a different picture. He was walking to work when he saw Slager on top of Scott, he said, who was on the ground. Santana said he could hear the sound of a Taser in use. He said he didn't see Scott go after the Taser, as Slager initially claimed. He said he believes Scott was trying to get away. \"Mr. Scott never tried to fight,\" Santana said. Neither the struggle nor the use of a Taser was captured on video, because Santana started recording shortly after that. Investigators from the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division found troubling inconsistencies from the very start, it said in a statement. \"We believed early on that there was something not right about what happened in that encounter,\" division Chief Mark Keel said in a statement. \"The cell phone video shot by a bystander confirmed our initial suspicions.\" Slager's lawyer, Andy Savage, has complained that he \"has not received the cooperation from law enforcement that the media has.\" Savage's office said in a statement that it has yet to receive \"any investigative documents, audio or video tapes, other than a copy of Mr. Slager's arrest warrant.\" The news release added that the lawyer has been advised that the police union that Slager belongs to \"is no longer involved in the case.\" Charleston County Sheriff Al Cannon said Slager's wife, Jamie, who is eight months' pregnant, and his mother had a visit with him at the county detention center Friday.  Slager was being held in isolation and being \"monitored for his mental health,\" Cannon said. In a statement, one of Slager's lawyers said the meeting lasted about an hour. \"His wife and mom were tearful but strong, and they were all very grateful for the chance to see him in person, even if separated by a thick pane of glass,\" the statement said. \"They held up family photos -- and even Jamie's ultrasound from earlier that day -- to remind him of all those who love him. Throughout the visit, Michael was focused on Jamie and their baby and was very relieved to know that she is being shown so much love and support by their families.\" A second video, taken from a police dash cam, has also emerged from the day Scott died. It shows moments before  the shooting, when things seemed to be going smoothly between Scott and Slager. Scott apparently tells the officer that he has no insurance on the vehicle, and Slager returns to his car to do paperwork. Then Scott gets out of the car and runs out of the camera's frame. Scott was the subject of a bench warrant over $18,104.43 in unpaid child support at the time of the stop, according to court records. That was why he ran, lawyers for the family said after the funeral service. U.S. Rep. James Clyburn, D-South Carolina, told reporters outside the service that Scott lost a $35,000-a-year job the first time he was jailed for failing to pay child support. \"He said it was the best job he's ever had,\" Clyburn said. \"Now you have to ask ... if you want to collect child support, there's got to be income. And you ain't going to make much income from jail. It seems to me that we need to take a look to how to deal with that issue without causing unemployment and the loss of freedom.\" On Friday afternoon, police met with a man who was in Scott's car, but the passenger's name wasn't in a police report obtained by CNN. He was detained briefly after the shooting, one officer wrote in the report. Scott family attorney Chris Stewart said he was a co-worker and friend. But he did not identify the passenger by name. On Friday, a few mourners trickled into the Fielding Home for Funerals. A white banner with a blue star near Scott's casket displayed his favorite NFL team. It said: \"Tradition, the Cowboys way.\" \"This is a heartbreaking tragedy for everyone in our community,\" said Riley, the mayor. \"It breaks everyone's hearts.\" CNN's Polo Sandoval and Martin Savidge reported from Charleston, and Ben Brumfield and Ray Sanchez reported and wrote in Atlanta and New York.", "annotations": [{"summary_1": "Funeral for Walter Scott is held Saturday in South Carolina.

{"id": "blog_16", "src": "'When I investigate and when I discover that the forces of the heavens and the planets are within ourselves, then truly I seem to be living among the gods.' ~ Leon Battista Alberti   I have been preparing nonstop for the past six days for the USMLE shelf board exam. You may recall it as the exam that left me crying a few days ago. Luckily I haven't shed a tear since. I've survived at Cup O Joe, Borders, and the ISP library from 8 am to nearly 11 pm every day. I had only a cell phone and this blog to maintain contact with the outside, living world. I listen to Los Lonely Boys and Modest Mouse every day in my car as a reward, and I even took tonight off to chill at North Market and Ben and Jerry's with some friends. Right now as I revel in my last moments pre-exam, I feel like my head is the size of the Hindenberg, dangerously full of information, and its going to explode over the next two days, spilling random medical factoids all over Columbus. Watch out dear city. I've never taken a two day test before.  It sounds exhausting. I guess it will be kind of like a finals week. Its been a long time since I had one of those. I don't recall having an exam this stressful since the MCATs. Although, I was one of the anti-premeds back at CWRU (most people didn't even know I was) and didn't really prepare for the MCAT at all. In fact the week before the test I was spending my days in Reslife training and moving into my new room. Given that experience, and where it got me, I guess I really shouldn't worry. I know my stuff and its just a matter of trusting myself when I have a good first answer. That is SO much easier to say than to do. Why is it that its so much easier for my friends and family to have faith in me than for me to have faith in myself? I haven't decided if I will study tomorrow or not. I'll see how burnt out I am after the second test. Upon speaking with the brown crown rumor mill, I've been told that this test has a way of making you feel like a dumb shit, no matter how hard you prepared, no matter how well you actually did. Knowing this in advance is somewhat comforting, because I know that I won't be the only one feeling like a medical admissions error.   All in all, I don't know what to make of this whole exam or how I'll do, but at this point in time I feel good about it and I'm looking forward to ending the madness Thursday. For now, I guess I just gotta go with whatever's in my head and in my gut and call it a day. Or two. Time for some cerebral fuel (sleep).

The girls backed out all of a sudden, and only left me, Ji and WQ to eat breakfast. WQ woke up at 7 (when I called), that lazy pig. Me and Ji finished our breakfast and he didn't get to eat at all, because we have to rush off to meet SL.  SL, WT and PY turned out to be 15 minutes late. HaHa. We waited outside the Hall for them, but we met them outside the school lor. We went to the gallery to watch (and was joined by lotsa Sec5s and 4s. They were terribly rude!) the performance. They was this dragon dance that went on for ages, but exciting too. The choir sang two songs. The first song was relatively unknown, but it was well-sung. The second song, Da Di Hui Chun, was very fast. I think they were too nervous liao. Cannot blame them la. After watching a few more dances, we went down to meet our teachers.  We first met Mrs Chua. HaHa. She invited us to her house to bai nian (actually, we siggested first, but she welcomed us all the same. HeHe). We are going this Sat. We then listened to the teachers singing. Mdm Huang was too high-pitched, and loud. She spoilt the songs. HaHa. Seriously!! Oh oh!! The Mr Kok was dressed up as the God Of Fortune and distributing (throwing, more like) chocolate coins around. HaHa. He came right to us and gave us the chocolate frogs. The juniors were all looking at us jealously. HaHaHa!   After that, we went to look for Mrs Jalil. Did you know she's pregnant? I sure don't. Ji told me she's about a month of so. No wonder la, can't tell ma. She was as friendly as ever. Mrs Tan and Mrs Chua joined us. HaHa. Mrs Tan kept telling us to come back for the Fiesta. Gurmit Singh is coming you know! Coolies! I said that we will sure come back one--to dunk the teachers! Muhahaha! We stayed on to chat more, then we left le. We (with the exception of SL and WT) walked towards Sembawang MRT and took the train towards Causeway.  We ate lunch there. I ate the mian fen guo. soon, HM and Gloria joined us for lunch, coming back from YJ. They then went to play pool, which I totally not intrested in (and have no money either). I went to look for Amanda and Wendy to wish them a happe new year and went back home.  I surfed the Net and played some games until Mother came back from work. HaHa. Some customers tried to come in after 7, but Mother refuse to let them come in ('They complain la, but we heck care! If they come in like that, how can we go back to eat dinner?'). Good job! We finally started on our reunion dinner, steamboat! It was a hearty dinner! Delicious!! Good good! Long time never eat le! The feast ended off with the drinking of sparkling cocktail.   We watched the movie on Channel 8, I went to bath and here I am (see...no tada today!)...online. Tada! (HaHa...I can't resist! :P) I found a new HP Interactive Site, MuggleNet Interactive. The site is so welcoming...and this time, I am actually using myself as the character (not a female one like Storm....hmmmmm). It looks real fun, and I bet I am gonna have fun. :)  Alright, I gotta end this le. I got a lot of things to do (mainly games playing) before going to to play with my neighbors. See ya tomorrow!

{"id": "blog_14", "src": "how i spent my sunday   Sunday afternoon I headed over to the dance studio where I was to meet Liza. We were going to eat lunch and see a movie. As I approached the studio (right across the street from the Fleet Center), I noticed a line a mile long (or maybe a hundred years) of slutted-up, overly made-up and underdressed hoochie-mamas. They were all in a long line that led up to the building where Liza's dance class takes place. As I tried to decipher the meaning of this surreal sight, I noticed a sign by the entrance to the building that read 'Coyote Tryouts.'  As I made my way through the line (choking through the odor of too much perfume) and grabbed the elevator, I met Liza on the fifth floor where she explained to me that the second floor was the location of auditions for a new 'Coyote Ugly' bar that's opening right down the street (next door to Boston's very own Hooters -- this is the classy part of town, as you can tell). I didn't know these bars existed. Apparently, the smashing success of the brain-cell destroying 'Coyote Ugly' movie has spawned real-life bars where clothing- and intelligence-deprived bimbos dance on the bars. I don't know if they double as bartenders or not, but for me, all I want in a bartender is the ability to pour and serve a drink. Save the dance steps for someone who cares, okay?  Afterwards, Liza and I made our way across the street to  urlLink Hilton's Tent City,  where Liza got a brand new mega-huge travel backpack for her semester abroad. Let me just say that this place is simply astonishing. Four floors  packed  with merchandise, the friendliest, most easygoing (read: not pushy) staff you could ever meet, and prices  way  lower than those trendy REI stores. Hilton's Tent City. Check it out. Anyway, while I was in there, I noticed the ever-growing Coyote Ugly line forming across the street, with a curious addition. A male thirty-something truck-driver type with a red ball cap and a beer gut had joined thier ranks. I pointed that out to the Hilton's employee standing next to me and he told me that the he talked to the guy earlier while he was outside. Apparently Red Ball Cap 'always wanted to be a bartender,' so what the hell. I sure hope he didn't have to wait too long before he was told that 'you're not what we're looking for.'   After lunch, Liza and I went to see  urlLink '28 Days Later,'  which we both enjoyed muchly. I wasn't sure what to expect, but it was directed by Danny Boyle, who did such a marvelous job with  urlLink 'Trainspotting,'  and the reviews were pretty positive, so why not?. It was quite the creepy, intense (and extremely gory) affair. Shot almost entirely on digital video, it had a grainy, sometimes inpenetrable feel to it, which only made the film more intense. One of the early scenes consisted of the main character wandering around a deserted London, wondering what the hell he missed during his 28-day coma. Very effective. Excellent music score, too (very unconventional and highly entertaining).", "annotations": [{"summary_1": "The success of the 'Coyote Ugly' movie has spawned real-life bars where clothing- and intelligence-deprived bimbos dance on the bars.

{"id": "cnndm_083b6c3239f969ae12491f14fc09b1f17d396983", "src": "(CNN)Authorities in South Carolina have released dash cam video in connection with the fatal shooting of Walter Scott, but the footage does not show the actual shooting. Video from the patrol car of North Charleston's Michael Slager shows an initial traffic stop and early interactions between the officer and Scott. Slager approaches Scott's vehicle. The two men speak. Scott tells the officer he does not have insurance and is in the process of purchasing the vehicle. Slager then returns to his patrol car. Scott exits his vehicle, briefly, and Slager tells him to stay in the car. Scott then gets out of the car, again, and runs away, out of the range of the dash cam. The video, which was released Thursday, also shows a passenger in Scott's car. The passenger's identity was not given in a police report obtained by CNN, but another officer responding to the incident said in the report that the passenger was detained and placed in the back seat of a police vehicle. Scott family attorney Chris Stewart told CNN the man with Scott was a co-worker and friend. He did not identify the friend by name. When asked what might have motivated Scott to run, Justin Bamberg, another attorney for the family, speculated that Scott might have been concerned about child support issues. Scott owed back payments on child support totaling $18,104.43, according to Charleston County family court documents obtained by CNN. He had a bench warrant issued against him for failure to pay at the time he was stopped by Slager. But Bamberg was adamant the dash cam video does not alter what happened. \"This dash cam footage does not change the fact that at the moment the officer shot and killed Mr. Scott -- that shooting was completely unjustified. And that is the key point of both the criminal investigation and the civil lawsuit,\" the lawyer said. The North Charleston Police Department is not providing more information, citing an ongoing investigation of Scott's killing that's being conducted by the independent South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED). Many questions remain about what happened on Saturday when Officer Slager pulled Scott over for what police have said was a broken taillight. In the police report that CNN obtained, a responding officer said that Slager said that at one point he started to chase Scott down a street. \"Shots fired and the subject is down,\" the officer writes that Slager said. \"He took my Taser.\" But a witness who shot cell phone video of the incident says he never saw Scott try to get Slager's Taser. Feidin Santana was walking to work when he saw Slager and Scott struggle on the ground, he told NBC's Lester Holt on Wednesday. Santana then took out his phone and started recording video. \"I remember the police (officer) had control of the situation. He had control of Scott,\" Santana said. Then, Santana said, he heard the sound of a Taser. It seemed to Santana that Scott was trying to get away and avoid being zapped with the Tasered again. On Thursday, a second witness spoke to CNN about what she saw. Gwen Nichols said she was in the neighborhood when she heard police cars speeding by and, curious, she followed them. She saw Scott and Slager at the entrance to a vacant lot. \"It was like a tussle type of thing, like, you know, like, 'What do you want?' or 'What did I do?' type of thing,\" said Nichols, who said she has not yet talked to police about what she saw. \"I didn't hear Mr. Slager saying: 'Stop!' \" she said. Feidin showed the video to the Scott family. But Santana has said fear for his own life almost kept him from revealing the tape. In interviews with MSNBC and NBC, Santana recalled the moments when he recorded the video. \"I ... thought about erasing the video,\" Santana told MSNBC's \"All in With Chris Hayes\" in an interview that aired Wednesday evening. \"I felt that my life, with this information, might be in danger.\" The video shows Slager shooting eight times at Scott as Scott runs away. Witness: I nearly erased shooting video out of fear . An autopsy showed that Scott suffered multiple gunshot wounds to the back of his body. Before the officer starts firing his gun in the video, a dark object falls behind him and hits the ground. It's not clear whether that is the Taser. Later in the video, when the officer approaches Scott's body, he drops a dark object next to the man. It's also not clear whether that is the Taser. It's unknown whether Scott took the officer's Taser or whether the officer picked the object up and moved it closer to the body. Slager has been fired and charged with murder. He is white. Scott, who was unarmed, was black. Timeline of events . Scott's shooting stirred memories of the Michael Brown case in Ferguson, Missouri, where an unarmed black teenager was killed by a white police officer. A grand jury declined to indict the officer in that case. But not everyone agreed that Scott's case is like Brown's or that race was a factor. Asked how he felt about Slager being charged with murder, Santana answered that \"no one can feel happy.\" \"He has his family, and Mr. Scott also has his family,\" he told Holt. \"But I think, you know, he made a bad decision. ... Mr. Scott didn't deserve this. And there were other ways that can be used to get him arrested. And that wasn't the proper way to do that.\" Lessons learned from Ferguson to North Charleston . The FBI is investigating, as is SLED. \"I have watched the video, and I was sickened by what I saw,\" North Charleston police Chief Eddie Driggers told reporters Wednesday. Mayor Keith Summey spoke at the same news conference, which was repeatedly interrupted by protesters who chanted: \"No justice! No peace!\" They called for the mayor to step down. Summey said that the city has ordered an additional 150 body cameras \"so every officer on the street\" in the city will have one. That is in addition to 101 body cameras already ordered, he said. Just before the conference was set to begin, demonstrators walked in. They were led by a man wearing a \"Black Lives Matter\" T-shirt who shouted, \"This is what democracy looks like!\" 2010 census data show that North Charleston is 47% black and 42% white. The makeup of the city's Police Department is unclear, though it's been widely reported that 2007 federal figures indicated it was about 80% black. Three of 10 City Council members are black. It's unclear what Slager's motivation was, or if race played a part in Scott's slaying. \"We can't get into the brain of another individual, so we can't state that,\" Scott family attorney Stewart said. \"I think it would be irresponsible to say that and try and inflame a community or anything of that nature.\" If convicted, Slager could face life in prison or the death penalty. Who is Officer Slager? An autopsy of Scott showed that he \"sustained multiple gunshot wounds to the back of his body,\" and his death was the result of a homicide, the Charleston County Coroner's Office said. Asked whether CPR was performed on Scott after Slager shot him, Driggers said: \"In the end of it (the video), what I saw was (what I) believed to be a police officer removing the shirt of the individual and performing some type of life-saving (procedure), but I'm not sure what took place there.\" When Scott's brother Anthony saw the video, he was convinced Slager's account of what happened was not true, he told CNN. \"There was not a struggle for the Taser,\" Anthony Scott said. \"I didn't believe my brother would have done that anyway.\" To  Anthony Scott, the videotape shows his brother was \"running for his life\" away from the officer. \"I think my brother was thinking he was not going to be shot, no one would have thought that,\" Scott said. Family members have adamantly repeated that they don't want protests over Scott's slaying to become violent. And, so far, the demonstrations have been passionate but peaceful. Scott's mother, Judy Scott, told CNN's Anderson Cooper that she feels \"forgiveness in my heart, even for the guy that shot and killed my son.\" \"He was a loving son, a loving father,\" she said. \"He cared about his family and ... no matter what happens, it will not replace my son.\" Who was Walter Scott?

{"id": "blog_8", "src": "[Note: I will be cursing through this whole section;  I haven't been this mad in a while].    I saw this article, and it pissed me off right away:   urlLink CNN/Aim Article .   Can you spot why? Read the article through first. If you can't, then congratulations, you've earned the 'I'm a Fucking Retard and I Have Been Listening to Fox News for So Long That I Can't Tell the Difference Between Partisan News and REAL News' Award.     First, some History.     Everyone thinks CNN is biased to the left and counterbalances Fox News which is to the right. If you think this, good job dumbass! You've been slurping up that bullshit Mantra of Fox News very well!     CNN is owned by AOL Time Warner which had Colin Powell, the present Secretary of State of the USA (Republican, for you dumbasses), who was on the board of executives for it. Now, his son is on the same board instead of Colin Powell. Naturally, they have become more conservative because of this. They have hired a lot more conservative hosts like Paula Zhan and others (can't name them all off the top of my head).    I'm not going to even go into Fox News. They are undoubtedly biased and even the dumbest twit can point it out (It was started by some rich Republicans and Journalists).     The Breakdown:     Democrats Roll Out a GOP-Baiting Reagan  BOSTON (AP) - Never mind Reagan Democrats. Here's a Democratic Reagan, or at least a Reagan who sounds like one on TV. Ron Reagan, son of the late president, was accorded a plum speaking slot at the Democratic National Convention on Tuesday for reasons other than his expertise as a dog-show host on Animal Planet. '    Ok, now, why the fuck did they bother to mention an irrelavent fact to start out: '...for reasons other than his expertise as a dog-show host on Animal Planet.' Um, ok. That's like me saying, ' President Bush was elected for reasons other than the fact that he got arrested for driving drunk in Texas and Maine, although his Texas records have been mysteriously erased now. ' That last half of my sentence was completely irrelavent and had nothing to do with the article. It's pretty clear that the writer from the get-go was trying to make it sound that Ron Reagan wasn't credible enough to comment on bigger topics. After all, he's a dog show host, right?   The prime - really only - reason is his name, the magic monicker of the Republican Party now pressed into the service of the other side. Nothing tickles partisans like seeing someone associated with the opposition make common cause with them.    Pressed into service? Ron Reagan AND Nancy Reagan (the wifte of Reagan) BOTH chose not to speak at the Republican Convention, you biased fucker. Why don't you fucking mention that?   In response to the second sentence: Nothing pisses me off like a report trying to act as if he's unbiased.   Republicans also plan an in-your-face guest at their convention, Georgia Sen. Zell Miller. The conservative Democrat insists he never strayed from his party, the party strayed from him.  ``Democrats like me have a courageous and honorable leader,'' he likes to say. ``It just so happens that he has a little R next to his name.'' That's R as in Republican George W. Bush.    That's a head-snapping switch from the 1992 Democratic convention, where Miller, as a keynote speaker, attacked the first President Bush and other R's with gusto. ``George Bush just doesn't get it,'' he charged. ``He doesn't see it, he doesn't feel it and he's done nothing about it.'     It's ALWAYS, and I mean always, been obvious that Senator Miller was a Republican in disguise. Basically EVERYTHING he voted on he sided with Republicans. If I lived in the area of Georgia which he represented, I would vote for the Republican without thinking twice. If I Republican, I'll vote for a Republican....I don't want to vote for a Democrat and get a Republican. I really question whether this guy has any values, or if he's just in the biz for the money.    Let's not forget the many Bush Administration officials who left his administration because he's a complete asshole (the Homeland security guy, Richard Clarke-Counterterrorism guy, and a few others).    A liberal commentator on MSNBC as well as anchor of canine competitions on cable, Reagan once declared the freezer section of his grocery store more interesting than Republicans. He made the comment when the 1996 GOP national convention honored his dad. He didn't watch.    He once declared the freezer section of his grocery more interesting than Republicans?  Holy Jesus! Another irrelavent point which doesn't address what he talks about.  I listend to Ron's interview on NPR, and he had a lot more time to talk about his views on pretty much EVERYTHING.  He didn't watch?  Something must be wrong with him!  He has his own political views!  In the NPR interview, he clearly held his father in VERY HIGH esteem and NEVER talked about different political views he had with his father...  Here what Ron Reagan said (this is NOT the CNN article....that article was too biased to put something like this in)   'The Bush people have no right to speak for my father, particularly because of the position he's in now,' he said during a recent interview with Salon. 'Yes, some of the current policies are an extension of the '80s. But the overall thrust of this administration is not my father's -- these people are overly reaching, overly aggressive, overly secretive, and just plain corrupt. I don't trust these people.'   For some odd reason, his mom didn't choose to attend the RNC either (as I previously mentioned).  Maybe because the Republican party has become corrupt, mean, among other things.  The article doesn't mention other things which Reagan often mentions.  He says that the Republicans are inconsistent and only say they are against for stem cell research for political gain and nothing else.  He brings up in-vitro fertilization, in which thousands of embryos are thrown away each year because they aren't used.  Shouldn't the Republicans be against this also if they want to be consistent?  The rest of the article portrays him as an unintelligent baffoon.  They should compare him to Bush, who can't even hold unscripted press conferences.  It's pretty funny...Republicans seem to side with Democrats when an issue actually affects them.  Otherwise, they don't give a rat's ass.  Reagans side with Democrats because of stem cell research, the Bradys because of gun control.....now we just have to wait for Dick to want Civil Unions because his daughter is a lesbian (seriously).

{"id": "blog_20", "src": "TV SHOW - TRADING SPOUSES   Tonight, I watched an encore presentation of 'Trading Spouses': Meet Your New Mommy. This show was a fascinating look at race, class and gender and how they intersect. The previous sentence is about as academic as this gets...  As a budding anthropologist, I could not help but read this as an unabashed look at race and class in America. A synopsis: working class African-American mommy (Mela) is switched with upper-class white American mommy (Tammy). Mela gets new, rich Japanese American cosmetic surgeon as her partner (and it's a two-fer because his mother, Nana, does *all* the housework and cooking - we later learn that Nana sets the coffee pot at night so that Tammy does not have to do it herself AND so that she can have a sleep-in...)  Tammy's new partner is the talkative, low-key (and cost-conscious) medical suppply supervisor, Anthony.  The contrast between the families' neighborhoods and lifestyles is so stark that Tammy, gazing out her window at her new lower-middle class neighborhood, wonders: 'Is there even a place for me to work-out here?'  Okay - a little aside. I cracked up when Tammy said that she brings  urlLink positivism  to the relationship - maybe it's because I've only heard this used in academics. Somehow, I don't think Tammy is a hardcore Comte fan.  I am focusing a great deal on Tammy because she really is the most interesting character to me in this episode - she is demanding, condescending, pampered - and she wants to 'meet every person in the world.' This is her way of telling Anthony that she was excited about being part of a black family and committed to promoting diversity by shaking lots of colored people's hands. Perhaps the phrase that best summarizes her outlook on 'racial understanding' is: 'You know, my husband is Japanese.' Yes, Tammy, you are a pioneer, well before your time.  For most of the show, I was thinking - is it some coincidence that the working-class black woman is represented as nurturer, not only to her own children but to Tammy's children as well? [There is a scene where Mela is seen putting together one of those thousand-piece puzzles with Niko (Tammy's son) and Niko says: 'My mother would never do this with me...' America's heart breaks for the child who has everything except the love and affection of his mother. Tear.    BOY NEWS - VENOM ENSUES  Still dealing with the aftermath of the 'big break up with boy'. The new catchphrase with he who spent the last four years of his life convincing me that he wants to spend the rest of his life with me (*SCARY*): 'I am not trying to replace you.' Which I translate to: 'I AM trying to replace you and it's fucking hard as dick.' He is dating the lite, calorie free version of me - a physical similar but not nearly as good as the original. (I go from self-hating to self-adoring when I talk about this guy, please bear with me.)  Anyway, as he was dating said downgraded version, he visited my apartment a few times to drop off mail and whatnots, did the whole clingy sideways hug thing (hiding a very erect penis, no doubt). Let it be said: I can be quite the source of arousal.  For some reason, this turned into weekly ritual and I had to end it ('don't touch me anymore, boy'). This, of course, created more longing on both our sides... The next thing I know, he was bringing over an installation disk and bam, his hands are under my shirt, in my pants, he tells me that he can't resist me blah blah...   'Oh, yes... this is so wrong... [grind] You aren't going to tell anyone, are you?'  'Who would I tell?' 'I don't know. My girlfriend?' 'How can I tell? I'm not even sure who she is.' 'But you're really smart. I'm sure you'll figure it out...'  The next day... I don't know why he came over this time, but I guess it doesn't really matter. I actually walked away at first and he - to use a trite phrase - was practically begging for it. I tried to do dishes (he knew I was feigning disinterest because I HATE washing dishes), the penis made an appearance, the rest is between him and me and, like, 10 other friends who've been hearing me agonize about this punk. Does a man who claims to be readjusting to a new relationship (with a person he claims to like) make the same 'mistake' with the ex two days in a row? Does our little indiscretion mean anything other than he gets to have his cake and eat it too?   I wanted him pretty badly and contributed to his little fall from grace in little princess kristin's head (apparently he told her, and since he doesn't lie unless it's by omission, she knows that *something* happened). We have a lot of unresolved issues, and I think this MIGHT have something to do with my clitoral confusion. But I am wondering... who am I to think that I am going to get some resolution by playing professor hookup j. horndog?   Sadly, at the end of the whole thing, he was all pissed off about how he might be perceived as an asshole by princess kristin - and did not seem to care about her feelings too much. (I call her princess because I fantasize that she, his same cubicle/co-worker, is this whiny - i've heard her voicemails, I would not be surprised to hear her saying 'mister... have you seen my puppeeeeeee?' - high-maintenance buppie who sleeps on a mattress with a pea underneath and stuffed bunnies on top.) But boy has never been really good about communicating so maybe he didn't mean it that way...

{"id": "cnndm_0ba73570295a5ca2951079aed5e1dc5fe7e58b21", "src": "(CNN)The sun hadn't risen at Garissa University College. Most students slept in their beds. A few had woken up to head to early morning Christian prayers. Then the terror began. It started with an explosion and gunshots around 5:30 a.m. Thursday (10:30 p.m. ET Wednesday) at the Kenyan school's front gates. The attackers continued to fire as they stalked through campus, with the Red Cross saying they stopped at a girls' dormitory. At one point, they burst into a room where Christians had gathered and took hostages, said lecturer Joel Ayora. A student in the room told Alex Kubasu, a reporter with CNN affiliate Citizen TV, that the terrorists sprayed bullets indiscriminately, striking his thigh. \"Then they proceeded to the hostels,\" Ayora told CNN, referring to the university dorm, \"shooting anybody they came across -- except their fellows, the Muslims.\" According to AFP, the gunmen separated the students by religion and allowed Muslims to leave. This would be consistent with the past practices of Al-Shabaab, the Somalia-based terror group that's claimed responsibility for the attack. That's what Al-Shabaab did in a December raid on a quarry in the Kenyan village of Kormey, near the Somali border, that ended with at least 36 killed. Whatever their religion, hundreds of students managed to escape, said Dennis Okari, a reporter with CNN affiliate NTV. Some ran. Some crawled. All feared for their lives. And they were the lucky ones. It wasn't until about 15 hours after the attack began that the explosions and gunfire around Garissa finally ended. Interior Ministry Secretary Joseph Nkaissery announced that four terrorists were killed and the operation had ended \"successfully.\" By then, 147 people were dead and plans were \"underway to evacuate students and other affected persons,\" the Kenya National Disaster Operation Centre tweeted. \"It is a very sad day for Kenya,\" Nkaissery said. Some of those students, at one point or another, were believed to be hostages in one of the four dormitories on campus. Yet others like Ayora managed to find safety, in his case at the staff residence. Others escaped the college's grounds. Okari, for instance, told CNN that he saw about 200 people sitting in the scorching mid-90-degree heat Thursday in a corner of a Garissa airstrip, surrounded by military officials. One student, Japhet Mwala, recalled to AFP how \"everyone started running\" after hearing blasts and gunshots. \"There were those who were not able to leave the hostels where the gunmen headed and started firing,\" Mwala said. \"I am lucky to be alive, because I jumped through the fence with other students.\" Rosalind Mugambi fled into a nearby field with \"bullets following us.\" She escaped unscathed, but a few of her friends did not. \"We saw some bloodstains,\"  Mugambi told AFP, \"and they were shot.\" Such terrorism, sadly, isn't new to the people of eastern Kenya. And that's largely thanks to Al-Shabaab. While it is based in Somalia, the militant group has made bloody incursions into neighboring Kenya -- most notoriously a 2013 siege of Nairobi's upscale Westgate Mall that left at least 67 dead. A primary aim of such attacks is thought to be sowing terror. There's also a religious undercurrent, given Al-Shabaab's once and possibly future goal of creating a fundamentalist Islamic state, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. Needless to say, that aim isn't shared in most places -- particularly in Kenya, where more than 80% of citizens are Christian. Such violence is more likely in towns like Garissa, given its location 90 miles west of the Somali border. What makes Thursday's attack different is what was targeted -- an institute of higher learning, presumably filled with innocent students with no direct part in the Kenyan and allied governments' fight against Al-Shabaab. Such an attack is more reminiscent of what other Islamist extremist groups, the Pakistani Taliban and Boko Haram, did in respectively attacking a school in Peshawar, Pakistan, and kidnapping more than 200 girls at a school in Chibok, Nigeria. Garissa University College began in the 1990s as Garissa Teacher Training College before evolving, by government decree, into its current form as a degree-granting institution in 2011. As of this spring, the school had schools of education, information science, and arts and social sciences. And it was growing, with its staff of 75 set to expand to 200 by year's end, according to the college's website. It's too early to tell what the future now holds for Garissa University College. But Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta on Thursday urged people around the African nation \"to stay calm as we resolve this matter.\" \"This is a moment,\" Kenyatta said, \"for everyone throughout the country to be vigilant as we continue to confront and defeat our enemies.\" CNN's Josh Levs contributed to this report.", "annotations": [{"summary_1": "NEW: 147 people are dead, including four terrorists, the Kenyan interior minister says.

{"id": "blog_29", "src": "Finished reading 'Hotel New Hampshire' again. First time I read it, I told the owner of the book that I didn't read fiction, because, well, who wanted to read stuff that happens in real life? I was fifteen, and a voracious reader. I read fantasy and sci-fi, because that's what my dad read, and Dad taught me to read. First book I ever read was 'The Hobbit', followed by the 'Lord of the Rings', followed by 'The Narnia Chronicles'. Definitely set the beat that I've been dancing to ever since. It was on the beach, and I was fifteen, and this unearthly handsome lifeguard who was much older than me and seemingly infinitely wiser showed me that fiction was not only interesting, but vivid.  I still prefer fantasy, though. Fairy tales, happy endings, heroics. I think it's partially because of the way I see the novels I read; I picture them in cartoon. Fiction becomes like moving oil paintings, and the effect can be beautiful; but where it's at for me is always going to be where there's magic; sparkles, and glowing things and the unearthly nonglow of ring wraiths and other fell things.   But, Mike, where ever you're at now, thank you sincerely for 'Hotel' and fiction.  The beginnings of Something Slightly Ambitious are brewing. I got all funk with out the George Clinton goodness the other day when I came the realization that I am, in fact, a lazy ass. Kept on thinking about it, and, upon further discovery, saw that I may not be lazy after all; I just need to be able to work from home. Or in other people's homes, away from people, the public, and supervisory types. I've not gotten into what that means; I\ufffdm content with identifying what my problem is.  So, I am going to work from home. This is most likely going to be a slow process, as I will be learning everything along the way. And since my superstitions about revealing plans seem to be correct, I'm not going to get into details. (For evidence on this particular superstition, recall the disabilities fund. I still haven't heard anything from those people. But, if I had have kept my mouth shut...)  Got Phoebe a carrier; it was the last one in the pet store, and it is ugly assed. We're talking flowers, and a lot of burgundy. Hideous. But it'll do the job, and is accepted all over the frigging place as far as airlines are concerned. She doesn't like it very much. Kurt thinks we ought to throw a blanket over it, because she really seems to dig tent-like places. We only got it yesterday, though, I'm sure she'll realize it's a fun place to be.  The press of bills are making it much harder for us to rest easy. I keep on kicking myself with that lack-of-job thing, but Kurt reminded me of something today: The University gave Kurt the money to cover the shortfall because I wasn't working; they were even considering not helping when they found out I was looking for gainful employment. Without that, there would be no loan at all this year. Also, Alberta gave us the maximum amount of funds based on that same rationale. In order for us to break even I'd have to have a job that racks in about 20$ an hour/ 40 hrs a week. Not only do I lack the ability to do that, finding a job like that is pretty much impossible here. Unless, of course, one is skilled.   What I can figure out is why there isn't help for me out there. Can't get welfare, Kurt's a student. Can't get disability, I haven't worked enough. So, sliding through the cracks is where we're at. Could be worse fates, I know, but having an eviction notice (although it didn't mean anything), having the phone cut off, and the power threatening to go too, all in the space of four months is enough to keep me nice and safely crazy. I have to call the province, and find out if they're hiding help from me, and harass Case Worker and Side Kick. It's intensely tiring. Did you know that to keep one prisoner in jail for 30 days costs 10 000 dollars? Maybe Jacen was on to something.   Wise man says much And to him, I have to say 'Fuck, buddy, whatever.'  Some time in the future, I'd like to move on to limericks, but I can't seem to get past the opening line. I'm aware that they can start any way the lyricist wishes, but I'm forever stuck on 'There once was a man'.", "annotations": [{"summary_1": "The beginning of Something Slightly Ambitious is brewing.

{"id": "blog_15", "src": "\u201cW\u201d go home  Written by: Carolyn Hileman  &nbsp;  It started that cold wet day in 2000, the comments, the harassment and the hatred. It continued even on September 11th when anchor men and women were attempting to blame that tragedy on you even before the ashes cooled. They never saw what we in Texas saw in you, they never tried, instead they used the fact that you were from here as a detractor. They laugh at the way you talk, call you a cowboy, funny thing is back here in Texas that is considered a term of endearment. To be a cowboy is the finest thing you could be here where you make it only by true grit and a true love of the country.  &nbsp;  They do not deserve to have you lead them; they have turned the Presidency into a big joke. Those people are actuarially proud of what your predecessor did while in that office. They hold him up as if he is something to emulate, even though the most memorable thing he ever did in the White House was disgrace it. They know nothing of true leadership, they don\u2019t want to know. They do not deserve a man who walked back into a target to lead his people; they deserve a man like John Kerry who was one of those who ran that day, let them have him. Come home to Texas and become the president of Texas, that is right I am suggesting that we break away from the Union.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  For a while now I have been thinking there must be a place where those of us who hold conservative values can live without the liberals breathing down our necks and telling us what they deem to be our rights. The fact is Texas is exactly the place I have been thinking of. Let\u2019s be honest here, we need absolutely nothing from the other states. As a matter of fact we send electricity and satellite signals to those states. There is really no reason to be involved with those other states at all. We grow our own food, hunt, fish, have plenty of oil, so what exactly do need from the rest of the United States that hasn\u2019t been united since our Forefathers past away.  &nbsp;  Their idea of unity is do it our way and we won\u2019t sue you, they don\u2019t even know how to read the constitution but can sit around and tell us how many so-called rights they have. Someone should tell them that no where in the bill of rights does it say that you have the right to kill an innocent baby. There is no right to get married, there is no such thing as separation of Church and state. They call us ignorant, at least we can read the constitution and Bill of Rights; we know what is in there and what isn\u2019t and we don\u2019t go around pretending that what ever we want is a right simply because it says we have the right to happiness.  &nbsp;  I say we give the liberals thirty days notice that we are about to become our own country and that they are no longer welcome here. Let the other Southern states, which would like to join us in our endeavor, become their own country and we will only transact with them alone. Let those Northern folks run the rest the way they like, let them have their Gay marriages, abortions and churches that are politically correct. We can bring the military to the South because the liberals don\u2019t believe in guns; we can even promise them that we will not use our arms or military to protect them in deference to their stance on gun control.  &nbsp;  So yes, \u201cW\u201d go home and lead a country who knows what true leadership is, leave those yellow bellied sapsuckers back in Washington. Come home and make Texas the greatest free country in the world, let them keep their UN, let them lick France\u2019s boot straps. Let them go beg the UN and Nato to protect them, let them deal with all those terrorist countries. We all know they will not touch Texas or anyone in the South because we don\u2019t roll over and play dead. You hurt us and we will hunt you down and you will know what pain is, we don\u2019t go for that politically correct war stuff we take care of our down here. So let them have their personal version of Hell and come back home.

{"id": "blog_36", "src": "[The brief introduction to this exchange is posted on April 19 as VOTING FOR LIFE: PREAMBLE. The following was written on April 16.] #15  Fanni writes:  In your most recent message, you depicted me as 'doing the same thing that you are doing.' I see this as a mischaracterization because it fails to take into account the dogmatic principle as I have identified it above (and because you have not established, in accordance with this claim, that I employ a similarly dogmatic principle in regard to corporations). You depict yourself as 'weighing plusses and minuses' as any responsible multi-issue voter would, but this characterization falsifies every essential point you have made about abortion so as to make it 'the most significant issue.' You wrote:   'I am doing the same thing you are doing, looking at an imperfect politician (I assume you don't agree with Kerry on every point, particularly the abortion rights point), looking at and assessing the evidence of his plusses and minuses, and coming up with more plusses.'   This attempt to establish parallelism between our approaches neglects the fact that, support for abortion, for you, and for reasons that you haven't explained, constitutes a massive minus, a minus so massive that it overrides all other possible pluses \u2013 so massive that it does not even permit a quantitative comparison with other types of killing and suffering and injustice or 'evil.' As for me, I do not approach any one form of violence or injustice with a dogmatic assumption that it is qualitatively far worse than any other. So, when you write,   'I could ask you the same question you appear to be asking me. How many unborn a day need to be killed before you disavow your loyalty [sic] to the man who has vowed to continue to work to expand abortion rights here and abroad?,'  my answer is that, to assess the importance of the number of abortions per day and decide what weight I should give this factor in my assessment of any given pro- or anti-abortion candidate, I need to consider the incidents of abortion in light of other forms of violence, both in a quantitative and qualitative comparison, as well as the candidate's record on addressing this and other forms of violence and the likelihood of the candidate's effecting change. I would have to make a new decision for every candidate and every new context, and never assume the contrary. In some cases, the violence done to the unborn will weigh more heavily than in others. To take a present example, it is my view that pernicious Bush administration policies in so many different areas have caused the issue of abortion to fade in importance in the 2004 presidential election, which is not at all to say that this situation makes abortion more permissible or even 'mitigated'; rather, it is to judge its perniciousness in light of other pernicious activities, many of which are not describable as corporate in nature.   Being a 'baby killer' or not being a 'baby killer' are not the only two ways of existing in the world. There is also a way that accounts for the violence of abortion other than as a radical, unparalleled evil. This other way tries to diminish the violence of abortion in accordance with its importance in respect to other types of violence. In other words, in taking this approach, I do not begin with the assumption that there is one qualitatively pre-eminent form of unmitigated evil in the world, or at least that there is one unmitigated evil that is the world's most pernicious form of unmitigated evil \u2013 the most unmitigated, if you will. And I am not, for that reason \u2013 as you seem to be \u2013 obliged to assume and to demonstrate if necessary that all other evils or forms of violence are merely mitigated, or less unmitigated than the evil of abortion. You have been resourceful in identifying such mitigating circumstances and qualities by arguing that this or that violence is merely mitigated because, for example, the president did not personally and single-handedly create the worldwide conditions which have led to millions of preventable fatal illnesses; it is not really known if Saddam Hussein was an imminent threat to the United States (despite \u2013 I insist here \u2013 massive evidence to the contrary); the American soldiers who killed civilians had been fired upon; the U.S. military reports that it handed out a little bit of money to some of the families of their innocent victims; only several hundred cluster bombs were used in civilian areas, and only several hundred civilians were immediately killed by them; only 17,000 or more Iraqis have been conclusively documented thus far to have been victims of U.S. aggression and therefore 'tens of thousands' is an exaggeration, etc., ad infinitum.   Unlike you, I am not motivated to elect abortion or any other form of violence as the one unmitigated violence, or the one, 'most unmitigated' violence. (And this is a separate issue, but I am also not motivated to limit my intake of news largely to one single news engine that agrees with my view on a single form of violence, and subsequently to dismiss all other news and investigative agencies as what Bill O\u2019Reilly from Fox News sweepingly calls 'elite media.') Although I am not nearly as thoroughly schooled in the history of abortion and its debates and the details of its practices as you are, I have a general awareness of it as a social practice, and a general sense of how widely it is used, how, and by whom. I am not compelled, as you are with respect to so many issues of injustice, to diminish its importance  a priori .   This difference between you and me has fed much of our discussion, and cannot now be swept aside, because I continue to mark my inability to follow you on the distinction you make between, on the one hand, the violence of abortion and all the responsibilities that are tied to it and, on the other, all other forms of violence and the responsibilities that are tied to them. To give another example, I do not understand why the decapitation by U.S. firepower of a three-year old bystander in Iraq is any more a mitigated form of violence and injustice than is the destruction of a three-month old fetus. In fact, I think this distinction between 'mitigated' and 'unmitigated' is problematic and ill-suited for this purpose, and I would refrain from using it in assessing the qualitative differences between different forms of violence (whose existence it would be ridiculous to deny, but would call for more refined qualifications). It would be perhaps easy to agree upon the reprehensible nature of any single act of violence, without consideration for anything but the time and place in which it occurred, but I would like to know if we could also agree about the nature of unmitigable offenses generally.   Even if we cannot agree on that principled level, there is a pragmatic argument that calls for not assuming that one form of killing is inherently the worst. If life were what mattered to you most, you would be willing to support, I assume, a candidate whose policies could make a serious dent in, if not eradicate, the 10.5 million infant deaths that occur annually worldwide on account of easily preventable diseases rather than a candidate that has a long shot at best \u2013 as George Bush does \u2013 at halting all the abortions that take place in the United States. Even if all the abortions in the United States were halted and all the fetuses went on to thrive as democratic citizens, far fewer lives would be saved by the complete eradication of abortions in the United States any given year than can easily be saved, beginning in the short term, by following the W.H.O. guidelines for addressing the 10.5 million annual infant deaths. (Preventing abortions worldwide would be an even taller order and, as his record demonstrates amply, George Bush is hardly the sort of leader who can marshal international support for U.S.-led initiatives, especially those that, for better or for worse, touch on the Christian heritage.) The international organizations capable of addressing these preventable diseases are already in place, and the project of, say, curbing the significant number of fatal malarial infections in Africa is not as politically divisive as is the project of outlawing abortion in the United States. Thus, such a humanitarian project, which has stalled alongside many others under the watch of a corporatized presidency, would be inclined to receive less resistance, and meet with greater success. The W.H.O. expert in the report we read claims that eradicating this number of preventable deaths would be relatively easy, with the proper financial support. Now, this is hardly a hair-brained 'hypothetical' at which you can simply respond by saying, 'I don't go there,' or a presentation of figures pulled out of the air with the intent of obscuring facts. What surprises me is that, after so many years of advocating 'life' and a 'respect for life,' and the 'right to life,' you seemed unaware of the extent of the ravages of easily preventable diseases on human populations. The question, in any case, becomes one of whether, in learning about these ravages, you would consider either shifting your fight for life to where it can likely have a dramatic consequence in the short term (by, for instance, informing yourself better on these issues and writing to your Congress members and to the President to complain about their irresponsible slothfulness and indifference with respect to these preventable diseases snuffing out children's lives) or giving up the pretense of fighting primarily for life and admit that there is some other force or principle animating the groups that appropriate 'life' as their rallying cry by calling themselves 'pro-life' while simultaneously limiting themselves to the narrow topic of abortion (whose narrowness I think is apparent when considered in light of many other life-and-death issues).   Although I don\u2019t understand the basis for your distinction between mitigated and unmitigated 'evil,' I perhaps do understand its necessity and the importance it holds for you. I say this because, to be able to so organize your political orientation in line with a single issue, you must disallow any other violence or evil of being fully unmitigated in the way you feel abortion is because, if that were not the case, then the other unmitigated violence or evil could just as easily serve to organize all of your solidarities and antipathies and, as a consequence, abortion would risk becoming permissible in many contexts, alongside many other secondary forms of violence. If you found a leader to be against unmitigated evil X, but whose support for other issues included support for abortion, then you would have to give your support to this leader solely because unmitigated evil X commands your attention overwhelmingly. And that, I think, is why I believe this single-issue approach to politics is untenable: because, in its arbitrary quest to eradicate a single form of violence, it is destined to support or show indifference towards multiple other forms of violence. That is the point I would most like you to reflect on; and this point, I insist, does not relate only to abortion or to abortion directly, in a substantive way, since it would apply, as well, to any other single issue that one would so embrace.", "annotations": [{"summary_1": "Fanni: My approach to voting is to weigh plusses and minuses.

{"id": "blog_31", "src": "Here In this diary I write you pictures of my summer, It was the best I ever had. There were choruses and sing-alongs  and that unspoken feeling of knowing that right now is all that matters.   The Ataris  I am heading home.  After far too long I am heading home.  After not seeing my family for seven months I am heading home.  I waited too long this time and am far more excited than I normally would be. Ive checked the weather back home every day last week. Someone brought cinnamon rolls into the office last week and all I could think was next week Ill be eating my Mommas cinnamon rolls.   I feel sorry for my roommates, Im sure that the mixture of stress and excitement and trying to get everything finished at work has made me rather difficult to get along with this week.  A week at home, reconnecting with my past and re-charging my self is exactly what I need      OHare is part of the national imagination.  Well really its more part of the national nightmare. Most of the country seems to only associate it with those nightly news images of travelers stranded in the middle of the great Midwest like refugees huddled against a cold Libyan night.  And yeah Chicagos first airport has been guilty of a few of those and maybe a few too many travelers have spent sleepless nights on her cold tile floor, but the airport seems to be working overtime to dispel this image and I always look forward to a layover in the windy city.    How can you not like an airport with two real bookstores, a Wolfgang Pucks, and a Chicago Historical Society store all with in the American Airlines terminals?  How can I not be fond of the airport that introduced me to the air travelers best friend, the Great American Bagel stand?  How can I not owe something to an airport that always has a nook where you can sit alone even on the busiest day of the year?  I deplane at gate H and avoid the main concourse there.  It does hold a Hudsons Book Corner, which at most airports would be a real find.  A real bookstore, not just three racks of paperback Michael Crichton novels and the latest in the Oprah book club.  But its still bright and crowded and features autographed copies of Traci Lords autobiography a little too prominently for my taste. Its the kind of place that has classics but relegates them to their own section lest the regular customer run into Orwell or TS Elliot while looking for the latest Candice Bushnell novel.   Down near gate G, past the Ms. Fields and the Tie Rack is a Whitestones. A large, dark, store, with an ample collection of older books.  It feels like the staff here has actually read some of the books and I like that.  I pick up a Kerouacs On The Road.  I have the feeling that Kerouacs adventures will be a little more exciting than mine, that hitching from New York to San Francisco live on a friends couch and possibly sail around the world working in the boiler room of a steamer is a little more dangerous than flying back to spend the week with your parents,   but I too am on the road, and it feels good to be underway.", "annotations": [{"summary_1": "Chicago's airport is often associated with the nightmare of stranded travelers.

Many people have praised the unemployed, single mother of six for going to the Mondawmin Mall and getting her son away from the escalating violence. Graham told Cooper that she saw her son with a brick in his hand, and she lost control of her emotions and told him to drop it. Wednesday night: Across United States, protests in support of Baltimore demonstrators . \"I did (get emotional). You know, once he threw that rock down I said, 'You weren't brought up like this,' \" Graham said. He's not a perfect child, but he's also not a thug, she said. The 16-year-old boy said he understood that his mother was there looking out for him. \"She didn't want me to get in trouble (with the) law. She didn't want me to be like another Freddie Gray,\" he said, referring to the 25-year-old man who died of a severe spinal injury after being arrested by Baltimore police. Gray's death has sparked daily protests over police brutality. There have also been riots and looting that prompted the city to put a curfew into effect. Graham said her son told her the night before the violence at the mall that something was up. She told him then and the next morning not to go. He swore to her he wouldn't. Her motherly sense kicked in when she heard school had closed early and the mall was shutting down, too. She went to the mall and focused on the teens who were tossing rocks and bricks. There he was, in sweatpants she recognized. They made eye contact. He had a brick in his hand, and that set her off. Wednesday night: Marchers back in the streets of Baltimore . \"I was so angry with him that he had made a decision to do some harm to the police officers,\" she said. She yelled at him to put the brick down. Singleton said he had seen her, but it didn't make sense that his mother would be there. But when he heard her voice, he realized it really was his mom -- and he was in big trouble. Then the camera captured her memorable smackdown. \"It was just World War III from right there,\" he said, showing some humor about the incident. Graham noticed the TV crew but didn't think anything of it. And she didn't care. \"I wasn't there to be recorded. I was there to get my child,\" she said. Tameka Brown, one of Graham's five daughters, told CNN on Tuesday it wasn't that hard for her mom to spot her 16-year-old half-brother. \"She knows her son and picked him out. Even with the mask on, she knew,\" Brown said. Brown said her mother is always looking out for her children. \"She has always been tough and knows where we are at,\" Brown said. Graham said she tries to steer her son away from potential trouble and troublemakers. \"As long as I have breath in my body I will always try to do right by Michael and show him what's going on out in society doesn't have to be you,\" she told CNN. Her son said that once they got home from the mall he understood why she pulled him out of the crowd. \"I was embarrassed a little bit, until she just started talking to me when we got home,\" he said. \"(She was) just telling me she did it because she cared about me. And it wasn't to embarrass me, but because she cared.\" CNN's Elise Miller and AnneClaire Stapleton contributed to this report. Watch Anderson Cooper 360\u00b0 weeknights 8pm ET.

{"id": "cnndm_0041698b4463a633f912681b96f73648cb012e33", "src": "(CNN)President Barack Obama took part in a roundtable discussion this week on climate change, refocusing on the issue from a public health vantage point. After the event at Washington's Howard University on Tuesday, Obama sat down with me for a one-on-one interview. I asked him about the science behind climate change and public health and the message he wants the average American to take away, as well as how enforceable his action plan is. Here are five things I learned: . The President enrolled at Occidental College in Los Angeles in 1979 (he transferred to Columbia University his junior year). While in L.A., he said, the air was so bad that it prevented him from running outside. He remembers the air quality alerts and how people with respiratory problems had to stay inside. He credits the Clean Air Act with making Americans \"a lot\" healthier, in addition to being able to \"see the mountains in the background because they aren't covered in smog.\" Obama also said the instances of asthma and other respiratory diseases went down after these measures were taken. Peer-reviewed Environmental Protection Agency studies say that the Clean Air Act and subsequent amendments have reduced early deaths associated with exposure to ambient fine particle pollution and ozone, and reduced illnesses such as chronic bronchitis and acute myocardial infarction. The EPA estimates that, between 1970 and 2010, the act and its amendments prevented 365,000 early deaths from particulate matter alone. \"No challenge poses more of a public threat than climate change,\" the President told me. When I asked about the strength of the science supporting the direct relationship between climate change and public health, he said, \"We know as temperatures rise, insect-borne diseases potentially start shifting up. We know, in a very straight-forward fashion, that heatstroke and other heat-related illnesses and deaths potentially increase, and so what we're doing here is to make sure that in addition to public awareness around the potential for big storms like Hurricane Sandy or big wildfires or droughts, that people recognize there's a very personal, potential impact in climate change, and the good news is we can do something about it.\" In many ways, Obama is attempting to reframe the discussion around climate change as a public health issue that affects all of us, while conceding that we don't fully understand the magnitude of the correlation between rising temperatures and impact on human health. When asked what the average American can do about all this, the President encouraged ordinary citizens, doctors and nurses to start putting some pressure on elected officials \"to try and make something happen to reduce the impacts of climate change.\" He also issued a presidential proclamation declaring April 6-12 as National Public Health Week \"to better understand, communicate and reduce the health impacts of climate change on our communities.\" The average American can also do their part to reduce their own carbon footprint, including: . \u2022 Change your incandescent light bulbs to compact fluorescent lights. One CFL can reduce up to 1,300 pounds of carbon dioxide pollution during its lifetime. If every house in the U.S. switched its bulbs, we could reduce the electricity spent on lighting by half. \u2022 Unplug your gadgets and chargers when not in use. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, this practice can save $100 a year on your energy bill. \u2022 Use a laptop instead of a desktop. Laptops are designed to be energy-efficient, because battery life is a major factor in their design. According to Energy Star, a laptop can be up to 80% more energy-efficient than a desktop. \u2022 Filter your own water. Beyond the environmental toll of plastic waste, consider just how far your water was transported before you bought it at the grocery store. \u2022 Adjust your curtains and thermostats. If you keep your house 2 degrees warmer in the summer and 2 degrees colder in the winter, you can save big bucks on your energy bill. The Department of Energy estimates you can save up to 15% on your bill by turning off your thermostat when you're not at home. Obama did not appear particularly concerned about the current Supreme Court challenge to the Affordable Care Act. He  said he believes the statute is \"clear and straightforward.\" He said, \"I am not anticipating the Supreme Court would make such a bad decision.\" At issue is the 32 states that did not set up their own health care exchanges and left it to the federal government to do so. The plaintiffs in the lawsuit contend that the language of the Affordable Care Act does not allow for tax subsidies in those states (without state-based exchanges), possibly creating a situation, for example, in which people in Massachusetts would receive a tax credit, but people living in Texas would not. Obama did tell me that if the Supreme Court challenge is upheld, however, there is no Plan B. \"Millions of people would lose their health insurance. They would no longer be able to afford the health insurance that's being provided out there.\" Obama went on to say, \"I think this is the last gasp of folks who have been fighting against [the Affordable Care Act] for ideological reasons.\" He told me that he \"gets letters every day from people who say, 'you know what, the Affordable Care Act saved my life or saved my kid's life because I got insurance.' 'I thought I was healthy; turns out I had a tumor, but because I went and got a checkup, it was removed in time, and I'm now cancer-free.' \" He added, \"I think stories like that will be factored in when the Supreme Court takes a look at this case.\" CNN's Ben Tinker contributed to this report.", "annotations": [{"summary_1": "President Obama says the Clean Air Act has made Americans \"a lot\" healthier.

Old?\" The man on the phone was offering us young children with the casualness of a market trader. After a week of back and forth phone calls, his initial caginess had given way to greed. He'd heard my foreign accent and clearly decided I would pay more than the domestic rate. \"We can get,\" he said. We'd been put in touch with the man through a contact on the ground. We were told he was one of the men running this \"unofficial\" displaced camp -- one of the many that has mushroomed in the town of Yola as the influx of people fleeing Boko Haram has grown beyond the capacity of the official camps. It had all been heartbreakingly simple. We'd asked who had children available to \"foster\" -- a catch-all code word designed to conceal the true intent of those offering up the orphaned children. The man on the phone was the end result of those inquiries. When our colleague want to see them, he was shown a group of children and asked which one he wanted to take. One, two maybe? He escaped by saying he needed to check with his \"madam\" -- me. I called. The man picked up and began referring to me as \"sister.\" I told him we wanted to know what we'd need to do, if we decided we did want to \"foster\" the children. He told me, \"Sister, Jesus will reward me,\" so the \"fostering\" was free, he said. No need for any pesky paperwork -- just a reassurance from me that the children, if I chose to take them, would \"live in my heart.\" If I could also then find it \"in my heart\" to donate to those still in the camp, then that would be \"God's work.\" In spite of the harsh measures the Nigerian government has put in place to punish human traffickers, by the government's own admission, 8 million children are currently engaged in forced labor. The Global Slavery Index says Nigeria has the highest number of people in modern slavery of any sub-Saharan country. Paradoxically, the group also rates Nigeria's anti-trafficking agency, Naptip, as one of the strongest government responses on the continent -- but it's clearly overwhelmed by the realities of working in what is now a zone of military operations, Nigeria's north. As the insecurity in the region has spiraled, the worry is that more and more children are falling through the cracks. And as Boko Haram increases its reliance on child suicide bombers, concerns are growing that orphaned children could end up in the hands of the terror group. At the camp where we finally met the man face to face, there was no attempt at subterfuge. We spoke in normal tones in full view of the children playing. I could have had one of them, I was told, but because I'd specified a younger child, they'd only identified one so far -- a 3-year-old. Did I want to consider an older girl? A 12-year-old maybe? She could look after the 3-year-old, and cook and clean. Either way, two girls would be ready tomorrow, he said. I could see them then. Our last phone conversation revolved around what an appropriate \"donation\" would be in exchange for the children. He couldn't, he said, bargain for it. He then proceeded to do just that, laughing down the phone at my first tentative guess of $200. Laughing again at $300. We finally found a figure he didn't find funny -- $500. I put the phone down and we traveled back to the capital that day to show Naptip what we'd found.", "annotations": [{"summary_1": "CNN's Zain Verjee and her team were offered children in a displaced persons camp in Nigeria.

{"id": "cnndm_08407e8a4629fcfbee9b3feb32574fb36e3f47c9", "src": "(CNN)You might call her a watchdog, because this Boston area Doberman really has a thing for timepieces. She recently ate three. Last Thursday, Jeff Courcelle came home from work to find 5-year-old Mocha -- a pure bred fawn-colored Doberman pincher -- hovering over a pile of screws, metal pieces, three watch heads and some chewed leather straps. \"My husband, who's the most calm person that I know, called me up and said, 'I'm not quite sure if I should panic,' \" said Courcelle's wife, Michele Parkinson. The 80-pound Doberman, whom her owners describe as \"more goofy than scary,\" had pulled down a basket of wrist wear from a shelf in their bedroom and eaten nearly all the contents. Parkinson knew that Mocha wouldn't be able to pass all that leather on her own. The couple took her to the MSPCA's Angell Animal Medical Center, a 24-hour emergency and specialty hospital, where a veterinarian performed a 3-hour endoscopy to explore the contents of her belly. Mocha was a repeat offender: Just last summer, she got very sick and had to have emergency stomach surgery after a piece of plastic from an orange juice container perforated her intestine. She had 28 staples down her belly and 10 inches of intestine removed, Parkinson said. Fortunately this time, the jewelry remains were still in Mocha's belly and had not made their way into the digestive tract. The X-ray, however, was disturbing. Parkinson and her husband were just expecting to see a couple metal pieces. \"It just looked like a Christmas tree and I almost threw up,\" Parkinson said. The veterinarian removed \"about a pound of leather straps and metal pieces and detritus\" during the endoscopy, and let nature take its course for the remaining pieces, MSPCA spokesman Rob Halpin said. As of Friday, Mocha was no worse for wear. The hospital sees dozens of cases each week of dogs ingesting foreign objects, and is trained to look for the symptoms of blockages -- typically lethargy, not eating and vomiting, Halpin said. They once saw a golden retriever who had stopped eating and found 43 pacifiers in her belly. (Apparently she was taking them from babies at the park.) And there was the 100-pound bull mastiff who ate his owner's brie that was set out for a party -- along with the cheese knife. The night Mocha stayed in the hospital, a nervous Parkinson stayed awake reading stories about dogs ingesting watches and other objects. She found one article about a Newfoundland whose owner knew something was awry only when he heard an alarm go off from his dog's belly. \"We've taken every imaginable thing that could fit down the gullet of a dog out with surgery,\" Halpin said. \"There's some evolutionary traits that some dogs have that lead them to eat first and think later ... and some of them are so food motivated that anything with a scent could be associated with food, and they go for it.\" Mocha likes to suck on fleece blankets and has been known to eat rubber ear buds or hair elastics, but nothing like a pile of jewelry, Parkinson said. Her breeder wondered if the dog was acting out of anxiety. That day, Parkinson had left Mocha in a different apartment the couple owns that the dog wasn't as used to. The breeder told Parkinson that Dobermans are particularly known to get anxious and do these sort of things. \"She had a dog that actually consumed her whole dog bed,\" Parkinson said. From now on, Parkinson said she will put Mocha in a crate if the dog will be staying somewhere new. Follow-up X-rays Monday on Mocha showed a few pieces of metal left, \"but they were moving along\" and the vet expected her to pass them naturally. Parkinson said Friday Mocha was \"her playful, energetic, curious Doberman self.\" But now that she thinks of it, the timing of this whole incident is a little suspicious. \"My husband was all excited about the new Apple watch, but couldn't justify a reason to purchase it since he owned three watches,\" she said. \"I am convinced that he and Mocha joined forces here to destroy all of his current watches in order to make room for Apple's new watch.\"", "annotations": [{"summary_1": "A Boston area Doberman has a thing for watches.

{"id": "cnndm_083322cf7cca49a6d1c6cefb23206f5b22934b4f", "src": "Marseille, France (CNN)Initial tests on the flight data recorder recovered from downed Germanwings Flight 9525 show that co-pilot Andreas Lubitz purposely used the controls to speed up the plane's descent, according to the French air accident investigation agency, the BEA. The flight data recorder, or \"black box,\" was found Thursday by recovery teams that have spent days since the March 24 crash scouring the mountainside in the French Alps where the plane went down. A statement from the BEA on Friday said its teams had immediately begun to investigate its contents. \"The initial readout shows that the pilot present in the cockpit used the autopilot to put the (airplane) into a descent towards an altitude of 100 (feet) then, on several occasions during the descent, the pilot modified the autopilot setting to increase the speed of the (airplane) in descent,\" it said. \"Work is continuing to establish the precise history of the flight.\" Evidence from the plane's cockpit voice recorder, recovered swiftly after the crash, had already led investigators to believe that Lubitz acted deliberately to bring down the plane, killing all 150 people on board. And prosecutors in Germany said Thursday that an analysis of a tablet device retrieved from the 27-year-old's apartment in Dusseldorf revealed that he had researched suicide methods and cockpit door security on the Internet. The correspondence and search history on the device demonstrated that the co-pilot used it from March 16 to March 23, Dusseldorf prosecutor Christoph Kumpa said. The search history was not deleted and also revealed searches concerning medical treatment, the prosecutor said. Investigators have focused on Lubitz's health as they try to establish his motivation. But the missing \"black box\" was expected to yield important evidence about the plane's final minutes. A female police officer digging by hand for clothes in a ravine that been searched previously found the flight data recorder Thursday afternoon about 8 inches (20 centimeters) below the surface, Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin told reporters. Usually white with florescent orange, this discovered recorder lived up to its name as a black box because fire had darkened it with ashes. In addition, out of more than 2,000 DNA samples collected from the crash site, lab workers have isolated 150 DNA profiles, Robin told reporters. \"That does not mean we've identified\" the crash's 150 victims, Robin said -- noting the recovered DNA still must be compared with DNA submitted by the families of those who died in the crash. Authorities have also found 470 personal effects at the site, according to Robin. That number includes 40 cell phones, though all those were badly damaged. Robin cast doubt that any useful information could be retrieved from those phones, given their condition. That view is consistent with French officials' claims Wednesday insisting that two publications, German daily Bild and French Paris Match, were wrong to report that cell phone video showed the harrowing final seconds from on board the flight. Noting he's made a criminal request to German authorities but is for now conducting his own investigation, the French prosecutor said he is tasked with an involuntary homicide investigation. But Robin noted that Lubitz made voluntary actions -- such as guiding the plane toward the mountain and reducing its speed to prevent alarms from going off -- and was \"alive and conscious\" to the very end. A European official government official with detailed knowledge of the investigation said that Lubitz's actions amount to \"premeditated murder.\" While cautioning that there are still many holes in understanding Lubitz's motivation, the disclosures about his Internet searches show that he planned to do what he was going to do, according to this official. Calls for crash avoidance technology . It is becoming increasingly clear to investigators that Lubitz was \"very afraid\" he would lose his license to fly because of his medical issues, a law enforcement source with detailed knowledge of the investigation told CNN on Thursday. It's already emerged that Lubitz had battled depression years before he took the controls of Flight 9525 and that he had concealed from his employer recent medical leave notes saying he was unfit for work. But the law enforcement source said that after a severe depressive episode in 2009, Lubitz relapsed with severe depression and stress in late 2014. In the weeks leading up to the crash, Lubitz was shopping doctors, seeing at least five, perhaps as many as six, the source said, as he kept going from one doctor to the next seeking help, including from a sleep specialist. He was prescribed powerful medication, though it's not clear he was taking it. Opinion: What if my patient is a pilot?

{"id": "cnndm_03b5f873e654678ac305c13fad6928030564b8e2", "src": "(CNN)James Holmes made his introduction to the world in a Colorado cinema filled with spectators watching a midnight showing of the new Batman movie, \"The Dark Knight Rises,\" in June 2012. The moment became one of the deadliest shootings in U.S. history. Holmes is accused of opening fire on the crowd, killing 12 people and injuring or maiming 70 others in Aurora, a suburb of Denver. Holmes appeared like a comic book character: He resembled the Joker, with red-orange hair, similar to the late actor Heath Ledger's portrayal of the villain in an earlier Batman movie, authorities said. But Holmes was hardly a cartoon. Authorities said he wore body armor and carried several guns, including an AR-15 rifle, with lots of ammo. He also wore a gas mask. Holmes says he was insane at the time of the shootings, and that is his legal defense and court plea: not guilty by reason of insanity. Prosecutors aren't swayed and will seek the death penalty. Opening statements in his trial are scheduled to begin Monday. Holmes admits to the shootings but says he was suffering \"a psychotic episode\" at the time,  according to court papers filed in July 2013 by the state public defenders, Daniel King and Tamara A. Brady. Evidence \"revealed thus far in the case supports the defense's position that Mr. Holmes suffers from a severe mental illness and was in the throes of a psychotic episode when he committed the acts that resulted in the tragic loss of life and injuries sustained by moviegoers on July 20, 2012,\" the public defenders wrote. Holmes no longer looks like a dazed Joker, as he did in his first appearance before a judge in 2012. He appeared dramatically different in January when jury selection began for his trial: 9,000 potential jurors were summoned for duty, described as one of the nation's largest jury calls. Holmes now has a cleaner look, with a mustache, button-down shirt and khaki pants. In January, he had a beard and eyeglasses. If this new image sounds like one of an academician, it may be because Holmes, now 27, once was one. Just before the shooting, Holmes was a doctoral student in neuroscience, and he was studying how the brain works, with his schooling funded by a U.S. government grant. Yet for all his learning, Holmes apparently lacked the capacity to command his own mind, according to the case against him. A jury will ultimately decide Holmes' fate. That panel is made up of 12 jurors and 12 alternates. They are 19 women and five men, and almost all are white and middle-aged. The trial could last until autumn. When jury summonses were issued in January, each potential juror stood a 0.2% chance of being selected, District Attorney George Brauchler told the final jury this month. He described the approaching trial as \"four to five months of a horrible roller coaster through the worst haunted house you can imagine.\" The jury will have to render verdicts on each of the 165 counts against Holmes, including murder and attempted murder charges. Meanwhile, victims and their relatives are challenging all media outlets \"to stop the gratuitous use of the name and likeness of mass killers, thereby depriving violent individuals the media celebrity and media spotlight they so crave,\" the No Notoriety group says. They are joined by victims from eight other mass shootings in recent U.S. history. Raised in central coastal California and in San Diego, James Eagan Holmes is the son of a mathematician father noted for his work at the FICO firm that provides credit scores and a registered nurse mother, according to the U-T San Diego newspaper. Holmes also has a sister, Chris, a musician, who's five years younger, the newspaper said. His childhood classmates remember him as a clean-cut, bespectacled boy with an \"exemplary\" character who \"never gave any trouble, and never got in trouble himself,\" The Salinas Californian reported. His family then moved down the California coast, where Holmes grew up in the San Diego-area neighborhood of Rancho Pe\u00f1asquitos, which a neighbor described as \"kind of like Mayberry,\" the San Diego newspaper said. Holmes attended Westview High School, which says its school district sits in \"a primarily middle- to upper-middle-income residential community.\" There, Holmes ran cross-country, played soccer and later worked at a biotechnology internship at the Salk Institute and Miramar College, which attracts academically talented students. By then, his peers described him as standoffish and a bit of a wiseacre, the San Diego newspaper said. Holmes attended college fairly close to home, in a neighboring area known as Southern California's \"inland empire\" because it's more than an hour's drive from the coast, in a warm, low-desert climate. He entered the University of California, Riverside, in 2006 as a scholarship student. In 2008 he was a summer camp counselor for disadvantaged children, age 7 to 14, at Camp Max Straus, run by Jewish Big Brothers Big Sisters of Los Angeles. He graduated from UC Riverside in 2010 with the highest honors and a bachelor's degree in neuroscience. \"Academically, he was at the top of the top,\" Chancellor Timothy P. White said. He seemed destined for even higher achievement. By 2011, he had enrolled as a doctoral student in the neuroscience program at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora, the largest academic health center in the Rocky Mountain region. The doctoral in neuroscience program attended by Holmes focuses on how the brain works, with an emphasis on processing of information, behavior, learning and memory. Holmes was one of six pre-thesis Ph.D. students in the program who were awarded a neuroscience training grant from the National Institutes of Health. The grant rewards outstanding neuroscientists who will make major contributions to neurobiology. A syllabus that listed Holmes as a student at the medical school shows he was to have delivered a presentation about microRNA biomarkers. But Holmes struggled, and his own mental health took an ominous turn. In March 2012, he told a classmate he wanted to kill people, and that he would do so \"when his life was over,\" court documents said. Holmes was \"denied access to the school after June 12, 2012, after he made threats to a professor,\" according to court documents. About that time, Holmes was a patient of University of Colorado psychiatrist Lynne Fenton. Fenton was so concerned about Holmes' behavior that she mentioned it to her colleagues, saying he could be a danger to others, CNN affiliate KMGH-TV reported, citing sources with knowledge of the investigation. Fenton's concerns surfaced in early June, sources told the Denver station. Holmes began to fantasize about killing \"a lot of people\" in early June, nearly six weeks before the shootings, the station reported, citing unidentified sources familiar with the investigation. Holmes' psychiatrist contacted several members of a \"behavioral evaluation and threat assessment\" team to say Holmes could be a danger to others, the station reported. At issue was whether to order Holmes held for 72 hours to be evaluated by mental health professionals, the station reported. \"Fenton made initial phone calls about engaging the BETA team\" in \"the first 10 days\" of June, but it \"never came together\" because in the period Fenton was having conversations with team members, Holmes began the process of dropping out of school, a source told KMGH. Defense attorneys have rejected the prosecution's assertions that Holmes was barred from campus. Citing statements from the university, Holmes' attorneys have argued that his access was revoked because that's normal procedure when a student drops enrollment. What caused this turn for the worse for Holmes has yet to be clearly detailed. In the months before the shooting, he bought four weapons and more than 6,000 rounds of ammunition, authorities said. Police said he also booby-trapped his third-floor apartment with explosives, but police weren't fooled. After Holmes was caught in the cinema parking lot immediately after the shooting, bomb technicians went to the apartment and neutralized the explosives. No one was injured at the apartment building. Nine minutes before Holmes went into the movie theater, he called a University of Colorado switchboard, public defender Brady has said in court. The number he called can be used to get in contact with faculty members during off hours, Brady said. Court documents have also revealed that investigators have obtained text messages that Holmes exchanged with someone before the shooting. That person was not named, and the content of the texts has not been made public. According to The New York Times, Holmes sent a text message to a fellow graduate student, a woman, about two weeks before the shooting. She asked if he had left Aurora yet, reported the newspaper, which didn't identify her. No, he had two months left on his lease, Holmes wrote back, according to the Times. He asked if she had heard of \"dysphoric mania,\" a form of bipolar disorder marked by the highs of mania and the dark and sometimes paranoid delusions of major depression. The woman asked if the disorder could be managed with treatment. \"It was,\" Holmes wrote her, according to the Times. But he warned she should stay away from him \"because I am bad news,\" the newspaper reported. It was her last contact with Holmes. After the shooting, Holmes' family issued a brief statement: \"Our hearts go out to those who were involved in this tragedy and to the families and friends of those involved,\" they said, without giving any information about their son. Since then, prosecutors have refused to offer a plea deal to Holmes. For Holmes, \"justice is death,\" said Brauchler, the district attorney. In December, Holmes' parents, who will be attending the trial, issued another statement: They asked that their son's life be spared and that he be sent to an institution for mentally ill people for the rest of his life, if he's found not guilty by reason of insanity. \"He is not a monster,\" Robert and Arlene Holmes wrote, saying the death penalty is \"morally wrong, especially when the condemned is mentally ill.\" \"He is a human being gripped by a severe mental illness,\" the parents said. The matter will be settled by the jury.

Sahra, a Somali refugee, left her home at 14 years old. Throughout her journey in search of asylum, she managed to overcome dangers and discomforts. But she never gave up, and she continuously reminded herself to keep going. She's the focus of Ines Dumig's photo series \"Apart Together.\" Dumig met Sahra through a photo workshop at Refugio, a shelter in Munich, Germany, for refugees and torture victims. What drew Dumig to Sahra specifically was her strength and her ability to effectively reflect on all of her experiences. \"It really impressed me how she deals with everything,\" Dumig said. \"She's strong in her way of connecting with the culture here and also reflecting on what happened, the culture where she comes from.\" The number of refugees seeking asylum in the European Union increased by 25% last year, with Germany receiving the most applications. One of the reasons Dumig decided to photograph Sahra is because growing up in Germany made Dumig realize that she lived a fortunate lifestyle. Another reason has to do with Dumig's interest in people's emotions and finding one's identity. \"I realized so many people want to come to Europe, and I always had the feeling to disappear or to go away,\" Dumig said. \"Seeing how people live in other parts of the world made me realize how privileged I am.\" \"Apart Together\" serves not only as a documentation of Sahra, but as a far-reaching story about people from all backgrounds. The title of Dumig's work refers to the fact that although people may be physically apart from one another, the comparable feelings they experience are what link all people together. \"Sometimes we feel strong, sometimes we feel lost -- that's kind of universal, I think,\" Dumig said. \"That's why I want to universalize (Sahra's) story as well, not only make it about her.\" The underlying themes of \"Apart Together\" include the feelings of isolation and \"otherness\" and the search for a valuable human dignity. Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. \"Every one of these (refugees) have strong stories, and in the bureaucratic system, they are just a number or a document,\" Dumig said. \"But they are a person, they are people with emotions and lives.\" Sahra is currently under the status of \"suspension of deportation,\" meaning German immigration officials may grant her discretionary relief from deportation. Dumig describes Sahra as someone living through an unresolved situation. Regardless of the challenges Sahra faces as a refugee in Germany, she is a survivor and the embodiment of resilience, determined to establish a new life for herself. She has learned to speak German fluently, and she has started working in the nation as well. Like an unsolved photographic puzzle, each photo within \"Apart Together\" provides a piece of insight into Sahra's experiences. There is no certain and clear way in which to arrange the pieces, because they are a representation of the fragmented nature of Sahra's life. Many of Dumig's photos are not of Sahra herself, but instead show her surroundings. This makes \"Apart Together\" rich in symbolism and challenges viewers to develop their own perceptions. The photos are powerful because of this symbolic nature, as there are infinite interpretations attached to each one. \"I think everyone interprets by themselves, by however way they perceive it through their own experience. That's up to the viewer,\" Dumig said. \"It depends on who looks at the pictures. ... Everyone will see something different.\" \"Apart Together\" allowed Dumig to share various special moments with Sahra, and they were both able to learn from each other. \"It was just something we both got something out of,\" Dumig said.

{"id": "cnndm_02fbe00a8ca19dbd1ddc989bde8f387e1ea34848", "src": "Washington (CNN)Nearly 6 in 10 Americans say that businesses that provide wedding-related services should be required to provide those services to same-sex couples in the same way they would all other customers, even if they have religious objections. A new CNN/ORC poll finds 57% feel businesses such as caterers or florists should be required to serve gay or lesbian couples just as they would heterosexual couples, while 41% say they should be allowed to refuse service for religious reasons. That's a shift from a Pew Research Center poll conducted last fall, which found just 49% thought businesses ought to be required to serve same-sex couples while 47% that they should be allowed to refuse service on religious grounds. Since the Pew poll last fall, Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act, signed into law in late March by Republican governor Mike Pence, sparked a nationwide controversy over whether the law allowed wedding-related businesses to refuse service to gay and lesbian couples. Apple, Walmart and the NCAA all spoke out against the law, while some states and cities with Democratic leaders barred spending public money in Indiana. Pence and other Indiana legislators insisted discrimination was not the law's intent and a bill to change the original law was signed in early April. In the CNN/ORC Poll, most Democrats (70%) and independents (60%) say wedding-related businesses should be required to provide services to same-sex couples as they would different-sex couples, while Republicans break broadly the other way, 67% say religious reasons are a valid justification for refusing service. Full poll results . Looking at Republicans and independents who lean toward the Republican Party, 60% in that group say wedding-related businesses should be allowed to refuse services to same-sex couples, but there are sharp divides within that group by age and ideology. Moderate and liberal Republicans and Republican-leaners broadly say wedding-related businesses should be required to serve all couples the same way (58%) while three-quarters of conservative Republicans favor allowing a caterer or florist to refuse service for religious reasons (74%). Among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents under age 50, 56% say wedding-related businesses should be required to serve same-sex and different-sex couples the same way while among those age 50 or older, 72% think they should not be required to do so. The big gay wedding cake quiz . Age differences hold across party lines, but the generation gap among Republicans and Republican-leaners is larger than that among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents. Overall, white evangelicals are broadly in favor of allowing businesses to refuse service for religious reasons - 62% say they should be able to. But among whites who are not evangelicals, 61% say such businesses should be required to provide services to all couples the same way. The shift from the Pew Center results comes across demographic lines. Men, women, whites, younger adults and senior citizens all are more apt than in the Pew poll to say wedding-related business should be required to serve same-sex couples as they do others. The CNN/ORC International poll was conducted by telephone, April 16-19, among a random national sample of 1,018 adult Americans.

{"id": "cnndm_0827b4ec5a5fb314c852865ec57b3185e453e009", "src": "Lausanne, Switzerland (CNN)A roller-coaster series of talks wrapped up Thursday in Lausanne as a group of world powers known as the P5+1 reached a framework agreement with Iran over the country's nuclear program. The success of that agreement remains to be seen. The parties have until the end to June to work out the details and put the plan to paper. But the talks this week were, nevertheless, historic, particularly for the otherwise frozen U.S.-Iranian relationship. But that's not to say they were glamorous. In fact, the negotiations this week provided a modern demonstration of diplomacy at its best, but also at its most hectic. Tucked amid the Swiss Alps on the shores of Lake Geneva, Lausanne is certainly one of the more scenic places to be trapped for talks -- a sort of Camp David for the rich and famous. But make no mistake: The site of these negotiations is also a gilded cage. Over the course of the eight-day round of talks, negotiators, their delegations, their security details and reporters were confined primarily to the immediate area around the five-star Beau-Rivage Palace Hotel, which played host to the negotiations. This isn't the first time the hotel has provided a backdrop to a major diplomatic event. In 1923, the Treaty of Lausanne was signed there, breaking up the Ottoman Empire and defining the borders of modern-day Turkey. More recently, the hotel has been a getaway for wealthy tourists and the occasional celebrity. Coco Chanel famously lived there in the late 1940s and early 1950s, and even had her dog buried on the hotel grounds, some reports say. 'It was tough, very intense at times' The setting is idyllic, and the grounds are beautifully maintained. The first-floor terrace even features a large-scale chess board, which served this week as an artful analogy for the game of nuclear chess going on just inside. For the negotiators, the past week was marked by a marathon run of meetings, sometimes lasting throughout the night. In an interview with CNN shortly after the framework agreement was announced, Secretary of State John Kerry said, \"I think there was a seriousness of purpose\" in meetings with the Iranians. \"People negotiated hard,\" he added. \"It was tough, very intense at times, sometimes emotional and confrontational.\" That sentiment was echoed by Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif even as the talks were still going on. Over the past 18 months since talks began, Zarif said, negotiators have \"developed personal respect\" for one another, even though serious mistrust still exists between Iran and the Western powers. \"We have a very serious problem of confidence -- mutual lack of confidence we need to address -- and we hope that this process will remedy some of that,\" he added. Media give-and-take . Zarif made these comments to reporters who swarmed him during an afternoon walk along the lake Thursday. Such ambushes were a frequent occurrence during the talks as reporters tried to supplement what little information was being circulated through official channels. Kerry was seen riding a bike on at least one occasion and dining at a nearby crepery on another, with both occasions prompting a cacophony of camera flashes. Reporters briefly followed Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi as he took a morning jog shortly after his arrival in Lausanne on Sunday. And Zarif took several lakeside walks with advisers and security personnel, perhaps just hoping to take in the view, but certainly not making any effort to bypass the area where television cameras were staked out around the clock. The officials sometimes bemoaned the media circus, but they also used the attention to bolster their demands during negotiations, making statements to reporters that they hoped strengthened their footing in talks with their foreign counterparts. \"People often use you guys to deliver messages to the negotiation,\" a senior administration official who asked not to be named told reporters on the flight back to Lausanne, \"as do the Iranians.\" \"I think they're quite skilled, actually, at using the media to deliver messages and to try to shape the frame of the negotiation,\" the official said. Different orbits . More than 600 reporters were credentialed to cover the talks this week. Many of these were based in a large workspace at the nearby Olympic Museum. Meanwhile, the traveling press corps covering the foreign ministers were given coveted red badges, allowing them access to the hotel, where the talks took place. While these journalists had a bit more access to officials, they were usually cordoned off inside a couple of claustrophobic media rooms and barred access to most of the building, including the hotel's reception desk, the first-floor restrooms and the two-Michelin-star restaurant's entrees, costing 200 francs or more. Many journalists found refuge in the more comfortable downstairs bar, a shorter walk from the cameras and satellite trucks used around the clock by television reporters on a rolling deadline. For meals, the crowd dispersed to a dozen or so nearby restaurants, where they could enjoy 25-franc pizzas and 60-franc hamburgers, washed down with 8-franc bottles of water, of course. Also popular: a Thai place around the corner that offered quick takeout -- a plus for reporters on a deadline. 'We'd all take deep breaths and try again' In the closed-off wings of the Beau-Rivage, the pace of meetings was frantic as different subsets of delegates gathered in ornate conference rooms. There was a sense of urgency, both before and after the initial March 31 deadline passed, to reach a final understanding so the foreign ministers could leave Switzerland ahead of other time commitments, not to mention the Easter holiday. The process was further complicated by restrictions on the flight crew for Kerry's plane, which could stay on standby at the airport for only a limited number of hours in a given time period. \"We'd get close, we kept on changing the plane schedule,\" a senior administration official told reporters. \"It would go, it wouldn't go; we had to reset the clock.\" On the evening the understanding was finally announced, the window had already lapsed, requiring Kerry and his team to depart at 3 a.m. Friday. There were \"many moments (throughout the negotiations) when we thought we'd call it a day, call it a night, decide we'd gone as far as we could go,\" said the official, who briefed reporters on Kerry's plane. \"Then we'd all take deep breaths and try again.\" But perhaps the most difficult night for negotiators was between Wednesday and Thursday, just before the final sticking points were resolved for a deal. \"It was a very, very intense,\" said the official. \"It went from 9 -- about 9 in the evening until 6 in the morning when we all decided we'd reached a couple of roadblocks, didn't know whether we'd be able to get past them, and we were all utterly, utterly exhausted.\" \"So we all went to sleep by maybe 7, got up again and started again about 9:30, and engaged on what we thought were the really final issues,\" the official added. Rushing to report the agreement . That morning, the deal began to solidify, and plans for the announcement were set into motion. The announcement that an agreement had been reached sparked some chaos. It was first sent out by the European delegation, which spread the word to its traveling press corps even as negotiators were still meeting. As news began to get out, one European reporter ran frantically into the media area at the hotel, urging everyone to listen. His message: There's going to be an announcement. There are buses waiting to take you to the auditorium of a nearby university where it will take place. And with that, the room devolved into chaos as journalists ran for the doors. The eight-day-long diplomatic event had hit its crescendo before finally subsiding. By midday Friday, the delegations had left Lausanne, along with most of the media, returning the scenic Swiss city to its more tranquil pace.", "annotations": [{"summary_1": "The P5+1 met with Iran for eight days to discuss the country's nuclear program.

{"id": "blog_4", "src": "Some women that I know just don't feel very pretty unless they have a bit of rouge on their cheeks, a tint to their lips, or some glitter to add drama.  Dangerously long eyelashes, at the very least.  Some women do it all; some indulge in only one or two rituals of feminine beautification.  Some women, like Simone, do one thing very poorly.  Simone, as I came to know her, was looking good, dressed as she was in a conservative black pant suit and black wool overcoat.  She held a newspaper, which is usually a sign of a well-informed, literate mind (unless the paper in question is the Sun. . .occasionally the Star).  In fact, the only thing that drew my attention to her was the fact  that she was applying bright red lipstick like she was preparing for an appearance in Cecil B. DeMille's  The Greatest Show on Earth . And the fact that on her newspaper she had scrawled, again in bright red lipstick, RAT FINK.  Otherwise, a perfectly normal middle-aged woman.  Her pattern of lipstick application was this: A--ever-widening NASCAR loops around her lips; B--a red dot on her forehead; C--colouring her nose; D--putting lipstick on her finger, then rubbing the excess on her cheeks; E--sticking the fully-extended lipstick directly up her nose and twist, twist, twisting it like a standard pencil sharpener; F--standing up on her tiptoes and reapplying to her lips.  She would then retract the lipstick, cap it, and place it in her pocket.  Then, she'd shake her head no, and start all over again with the same pattern as described above. This cycle continued with little change until a Braintrust sitting opposite her dropped his bottle of Canadian Sherry (screw cap) and, while already unsteady on his pins, began to chase the runaway libation down the moving streetcar.   I would have been happy had I witnessed either event on my way home; to see both was a rare delight. Once Johnny Snakebite had reeled in his catch of fortified wine, he decided to deboard.  Noticing Simone, he enquired:  A- 'What's yer fuckin' trip?' B- (with surprising conviction)'Lipstick.  Lipstick is my trip.'  One mystery solved.  Simone liked lipstick.  At the same time, at the front of the streetcar, a woman boarded who serves as a perfect example of my argument that people in Toronto pay ABSOLUTELY NO ATTENTION to what is going on around them.  For obvious reasons Simone was sitting by herself; the new commuter plopped down right beside her. Simone was, by this time, more red in the face than W.C. Fields.  She was clearly not sane. The best moment on my ride yet was this when this oblivious newcomer stole a glance, as all commuters do, at her seatmate.  She nearly jumped out of her skin.  And just guess what her first words were--  C-'I think that you have enough lipstick on.'  I have to give her some credit: she was only saying what we were all thinking. Well, to be honest I was thinking 'Holy FUCK, she's got a lot of lipstick on!!'.  And do you know what our lovely little Simone said, without missing a beat?  B-'Gotta take care of my lips; my lips are my ticket!  I'm a lip model!'  For a moment I admired the clever wit of Simone and her lightning-fast mind.  Perhaps there was more method to her madness than I was giving her credit for!  Maybe the light behind her eyes was not quite as dim as I had thought?  The golden rule of 'Judge not lest ye be judged!' came to mind--all those moments when my mother had scolded, 'Don't judge a book by its cover!', 'Still waters run deep', etc. etc. etc.  Then I noticed that Simone had stuck her lipstick so deep into her nose that it began to bleed. Book covers be damned.  This woman was crazy.", "annotations": [{"summary_1": "A woman on a Toronto subway train was applying lipstick like she was preparing for an appearance in Cecil B.

On Kabul's streets, you can easily find the uneasy legacy of America's longest war. Outside one mosque -- mixing with other men desperate for a day's worth of casual manual labor -- are five men who months ago had one valuable skill NATO depended upon: they speak English. Now however, their world has turned upon them. They were, each for a different reason -- each for a reason they do not understand -- all fired from their jobs and then blacklisted, they say, meaning they can no longer get work with other government groups or NGOs here. The skill they once thrived off has left them isolated, and fearing reprisals. They sleep in market stalls, and avoid traveling to see their families in case the threats they face are visited upon them. \"My family is still living in the provinces,\" one of the men tells me. \"I cannot go there. I am living in a market, in one of the empty shops.\" Another adds: \"My family, everybody, give up on me, they are nervous.\" A third man -- all requested anonymity -- says: \"Right now I sleep here, on the street, in this mosque area.\" \"We are in prison in Afghanistan,\" a fourth says. The U.S. Embassy and NATO declined to comment for this story. EXCLUSIVE: The last Americans in Afghanistan . Helicopters still buzz around the capital. Its population is five times what it was when NATO arrived here, even by the most conservative estimates, and the violence in the provinces means people swell it further still -- arriving in Kabul's dusty, mountainous bowl of a city in order to avoid the fighting. Neighborhoods that were once massively over-priced cliques of foreigners living in \"poppy palaces\" -- villas allegedly bought from profiteers of the opium trade -- are now empty. One road, forever pot-holed in the past decade, is now being covered over by Afghans who, it seems, are finally reclaiming that street. Even Chicken Street, the hackneyed pedestrian shopping road where new Western arrivals would buy carpets or local trinkets, is more or less deserted. One shopkeeper says it could be the embassy security warnings that are keeping people away now. It is the same for the restaurants here that used to brim with contractors and NGO workers. They are now empty, the sound of their heavy metal doors echoing across deserted tables. It is immeasurably different to three years ago when I lived there. Drive out east -- past the women in burqas who sit on road bumps, holding their children, hoping drivers will slow enough to throw them change -- and you see roads lined with the detritus of America's war here. Huge lines of excavators, cherry-pickers, and forklift trucks sit idle. At times it seemed there was little America wouldn't do, or try, to meets its often fluid goals in the country. Yet today, the machines that could have once moved small mountains do little more than gather dust. EXCLUSIVE: Afghan woman forced to marry her rapist . Further down the road too are more winners-turned-losers of the NATO presence here. Vast supply chains once kept 120,000 troops fed and watered. Trucks lined the roads and climbed up to the military bases. Now the bases are gone, and the trucks that once supplied millions sit still. Their bosses may have fled abroad with their winnings, yet the drivers have been left behind, stuck with vehicles that cost them $30,000 to buy -- and $1,000 a year just to keep on the road -- but that would fetch just a tenth of that price now. \"The contracts were with big businessmen and commanders who were giving us very little and made themselves very rich and are now living comfortably in Dubai,\" one truck driver tells us. Yet still the wedding palaces proliferate. Along one stretch of road their endless, multiplying lights throb. Each night the houses seem packed -- the commitment to the future still is popular here, despite the uncertainty -- even if the lights that decorate them seem more and more like a symbol of leaving. One set actually replicates the shape of an expensive hotel in Dubai. The city's lights do shine staggeringly and often constantly -- something the Taliban never achieved during their rule here. NATO's efforts to keep them on are reported to have involved diesel power stations that cost billions but were barely switched on. The question many surely ask here -- as the last American troops prepare to retreat inside the U.S. Embassy by the end of next year -- is how much longer the lights will continue to glow.

{"id": "blog_0", "src": "A great number of things happened today after I stopped gazing lovingly at my GBA SP and actually left the apartment.  It's been bone-chillingly cold here the last couple days, and gas has been expensive, so I wanted to limit my toy-hunting.  So after one more in a long series of disappointing Wal-Mart trips, Graham and I decided to hit our closest TRU and next-closest Target before heading to Walky's for the Energon premere.  That was the jackpot.  TRU had the wave-2 Energon basics, Alternators Sideswipe, and two My Little Pony TRU exclusives that I had been looking for.  I picked up the ponies and all the basics but Cruellock, who there was only one of.  Graham got Sideswipe, but I skipped him because I was already spending so much.  Spending so much, in fact, that I knew I was just going to have to put off Anniversary Prime until the next paycheck if I found him.  So naturally, that's exactly what I found at Target.  Right there on the shelf, the masterpiece, the toy that left me simply  moved  looking at him in ToyFare, the figure I wanted more than anything...and I really couldn't justify the $70.  And he had the grey gun, and I wanted to wait for the black gun anyway...*sigh*  But all was not lost, and a quick justification of the purchase of my cell phone later and I was picking him up for Walky.  Once we made it to his place I could still spend the evening making lewd comments about it!  Yay!  Energon was...really, really good.  I might spoil a little here, so you Canucks and those waiting for copies should skip this paragraph.  I always expect the first episode of a series like this to have above-average animation, but this was absolutely stunning.  If the rest of the series can be even half this good, it will be spectacular.  The CG used for the robots not only gives them a proper 'other' feel, but it saves them from inconsistant art.  Not that that seems to be a real issue, as even the cel-drawn humans were well animated.  There are some elements that will clearly have to be explained later, like why Primus has become The Voice in Prime's Head and where he came from, anyway, and what the deal is with the apparently both sentient and generic Omnicons, but nothing leaves me thinking those won't be explained.  (Unlike Armada, where a number of things were never satisfactorily explained.)  Kicker was immediately recognizable as my beloved  urlLink Brad Swaile , and he was certainly an interestingly different 'kid' character.  I loved the flashback to his first visit to Cybertron, with the Autobots as horrifying giant monsters.  I see actual development in the future here.  Also, I could never tell if Hot Shot was supposed to sound gruffer or if it was just him being  really  pissed at Kicker.  Though if he doesn't start with the character development sometime soon he might start getting on my nerves.  He's pretty obnoxious, but in an understandable 16-year-old way.  I was floored by their flaunting of Ironhide's vehicle-mode head, at least until I remembered Robots in Disguise's fondness for that sort of thing.  That's Japan for you.

{"id": "blog_30", "src": "To clear up any confusion, my first academic year as a graduate student is over (miraculously, it seems). Being a field ecologist, I actually run my master's experiment this summer. So, while my friends in different sorts of programs are studying for comprehensive exams and/or seeking summer employment, I'm getting credit and a (none too large) summer stipend to bascially do research full time. Which, hey, is nice, lack of regularly sized paychecks aside.  My field experiment involves no-till soy plots, so I've been biding time with other tasks and readying for the actual fieldwork whilst the soy was planted, sprayed with herbicide.... etc. Sunday and Monday I flagged my plots within the fields, and tomorrow (!!!) I get to go till the 60 2x2 m plots. My mom commented on her visit in early May that doing something so agricultural was more 'like' me.  Hmmmm.  There is a trend I have noticed. The hotshots-- meaning arrogant people, who may or may not be talented, that varies quite a bit, ironically-- drop out of challenging things much more often than I ever expect them to. And I have thought about quitting during what I hope was the worst of it, but I didn't.  Hrrrrrm. Curioser and curioser, says Alice.  This weekend an email from a college friend informed me that I seemed to be getting along with grad school very well, whereas her other friends who went into grad school in biology all quit after the first year. Hmmmm. If she means who I think she does, there are these two guys who got fellowships-- money, no teaching, for the first year if not 2 years. I got a package which, for my school, is really good, but compared to other schools, it's decent but nothing flashy. I only TA for a year, and that's done now, and the remaining year is a Research Assistantship-- paid to do my own lab work. Which is sweet, and typical of grad school, but many Master's students here don't get a full year of an RA. They get half a year. So I've been content with my situation, award-wise. And I get research money to travel on since I am collaborating a bit. So it's all good. But this time last year, as a senior in college, to hear the pompous ass twins got really good deals and didn't have to TA was disheartening. Well, I survived TAing, and am still here fighting it out. So I'm rather proud of me, which is a good thing, since there have definitely been times this year when I started planning in my head the steps I would need to take to pick up and leave the program. Right down to packing my clothes. That's a lie-- I was planning packing my clothes without having figured out the important things, like my lease or whether my advisor would ever speak to me again. But I had the socks in the boxes, and was wondering how expensive apartments that allowed cats are in my hometown, and if the zoo needed any keepers. Alas.  Ok I've spent an hour and half not working when I should have been. Time to tweak some things in a file I'm working on and go home to shower. You see, I smell like gasoline. Why? There was a potential tick issue due to a cicada collecting trip outside in my not-field jeans, so I changed into my snazzy fields overalls upon my return from the field, which still smell of gasoline after yesterday's adventures. Which I could possibly relate in a later post. Hence I look incredibly sexy and smell like gasoline, and am inside my office in said state. Which is why a shower is necessary before I go to a music festival with a friend.  The interesting question, really, is whether to bike home in the gas-overalls or the tick-jeans.

{"id": "cnndm_0ae2b322a93bf193821727c3a7fdf8d3f44d1019", "src": "(CNN)Protests are gaining steam in Baltimore after a man died from a devastating injury he allegedly suffered while in police custody. Demonstrators have vowed they'll keep taking to the streets until they get justice. To start, protesters say they're looking for answers about what happened to Freddie Gray, and why. But it seems like the questions in the controversial case just keep growing. Protesters rallied at Baltimore City Hall on Thursday, and another march is planned for Saturday. Here's a look at key issues protesters are asking about: . Police say when Gray saw police on April 12, he started running. Within minutes, they caught up with him and arrested him after finding a knife in his pocket. Protesters have echoed the claims of the Gray family's attorney, who argues that police didn't have any probable cause to pursue him, but chased him for \"running while black.\" Baltimore Police union attorney Michael Davey told reporters Wednesday that officers had every right to chase Gray. \"There is a Supreme Court case that states that if you are in a high-crime area, and you flee from the police unprovoked, the police have the legal ability to pursue you, and that's what they did,\" he said. \"In this type of an incident, you do not need probable cause to arrest. You just need a reasonable suspicion to make the stop.\" An autopsy says Gray died from a severe spinal cord injury. His family says his voice box was crushed and his neck snapped before he slipped into a coma and later died. Police say they spotted Gray, gave chase, caught him, cuffed him and requested a \"wagon\" to transport him in less than four minutes. The transport van left with Gray about 11 minutes afterward, police said, and another 30 minutes passed before \"units request paramedics to the Western District to transport the suspect to an area hospital.\" Protesters want to know exactly what happened in those 30 minutes, and say it's clear police used too much force when Gray was in their custody. Investigators still haven't said what happened inside the van. Union officials from the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 3 say something happened inside the vehicle, but they don't know what. Baltimore Police Commissioner Anthony Batts told CNN affiliate WJZ that another prisoner inside the van said he didn't see any harm done to Gray. \"What he has said is that he heard Freddie thrashing about,\" Batts said. \"The driver didn't drive erratically, wasn't slamming on breaks, wasn't turning corners fast or in an irrational way.\" Five of the six officers involved in Gray's arrest have provided statements to investigators, the Baltimore Police Department said Wednesday. \"They have completely cooperated with the investigation from Day 1,\" Davey told reporters. But details of what the officers said haven't been released yet by authorities. Neither have the officers' personnel records or photos. Police say doing that would violate the law. The lack of details a week and a half after the incident is fueling cries from the public, and the lawmakers who represent them. Protesters say police should be releasing what they know now. Baltimore Police officials say they're being as transparent as they can about the case while their criminal investigation is ongoing. And they say they plan to hand over details from the investigation to the State Attorney's Office next week. Some protesters say the officers should be charged with murder for Gray's death. Officials say an investigation is ongoing, and all  the officers involved have been suspended with pay. At this point, it isn't clear whether any charges will be filed. The U.S. Justice Department is also investigating the case. The police union said it's 100% behind the officers and compared protesters to a lynch mob, accusing them of calling for charges against officers without knowing the facts of the case or giving them a day in court. \"There is, at this time, no indication of any criminal activity whatsoever,\" the union's statement said, \"but our support will not waiver for any reason.\" Gray's case is getting a lot of attention. But protest organizers say it's emblematic of a broader problem. Some protesters say it's not the only time they've seen police brutality on the streets of their city. Long before they took to the streets to demonstrate over Gray's death, some of them had already been at city hall, voicing their concerns over other cases. \"Right now there's a lot of mistrust. They feel it's us versus them,\" Baltimore City Council President Jack Young said. \"It should not be that way and it needs to be fixed.\" According to the Baltimore Sun, the city has paid more than $5.7 million since 2011 for more than 100 cases involving allegations of police wrongdoing. Police didn't admit fault in any of the cases. The police union said in a statement on Wednesday that the reason for the settlements was simple: City officials believe lawsuits are too costly. \"Let us be clear, we completely disagree with this policy, as many of these cases are settled without concern for the facts but, rather, to avoid the high cost of defending a potential lawsuit. We believe that these cases should be decided in court where proper time and attention can be given,\" the union said. \"The ease of settlement, and substantial award amount, has led to the unjustified perception of an increase in brutality complaints.\" CNN's Dana Ford, Eliott C. McLaughlin, Suzanne Malveaux, Jake Tapper, Miguel Marquez, Brian Todd, Polo Sandoval, Justin Lear, Jason Carroll and Patrick Cornell contributed to this report.", "annotations": [{"summary_1": "Police say they chased Freddie Gray for \"running while black\" Protesters want to know what happened in the 30 minutes before paramedics arrived.

{"id": "blog_27", "src": "So last night a friend of mine had a suprize birthday party. This friend of mine is older .. she turns 60 this weekend, and her kids threw her a wing ding - complete with friends flying in from both New York and California.  I was suprized to see when I got the invitation that the party was in Buckhead.... cause I didn't think of her as a Buckhead party girl ( Buckhead is a part of Atlanta that used to be pretty fun with lots of bars and clubs and stuff ... and somewhere it got less fun, or I got older .... either way - if you're in Atlanta, I recomment the Highlands area ... but i digress... i do that a lot)  So my friends and I get to the club....not without driving in oncoming traffic's land and almost getting killed - but we didn't - so there's that ...... so we get there -and climb up about 500 stairs to this 'party room' that's attached to a bar downstairs.  Dear Readers ( both of you ) i have 3 words ... No Air Conditioning .... and a few more words .... there's a band downstairs warming up right underneath us - so there's the whole 'our' music competing for 'their' music.  Although one friend of mine 'Ann P.'  discovered that sitting at the right angle on the chair while the bass was seriously thumping was NOT an completly bad thing.      Anyho, Allie hadn't eaten all day - so perhaps starting by drinking a Manhattan in about 3 seconds wasn't the way to go - so i moved on to my dear friend Corona....and ran into an old friend ... it was unexpected to see her - but according to some there - she kept talking bout how pretty i looked - and whether you dig girls or boys - a compliment is a compliment ... just wish there was a boy there saying such things - but whatever ..... man, I'm digressing again....      So she was suprized...and that's cool - she was THRILLED to see her friends from college there .... then the music started -  LOUD. This is where i realized I'm too old. Small room, LOUD music, not able to talk, I really am a drinker and a chatter, i like dancing when dancing is happening, but loud music just for loud music doesn't work for me, and by 10:30 ... i was starting to be REAL ready to go and do something else .... so us being us ....what did we do?? yes. that's right. we ate.  a little veggie sushi is good for whatever ails ya.   Then i headed back home to mike....listening to Al Green all the way ...... if you have to be alone listening to Al, the only way to do it is LOUD with the windows down imagining that you're dancing in the arms of someone safe that makes you smile.      maybe i'll find that guy at the next party.", "annotations": [{"summary_1": "A friend of a friend had a surprise 60th birthday party last night.

{"id": "blog_5", "src": "Sunday morning and rain is truly falling.  I promised C an optimistic entry yesterday, lol, so I'll try to keep it as light as possible.  Except the sun just came out, which frustrates me.  So much has happened in the past two days that it's just overwhelming. So we'll just start with Friday.  YSP reunion. First time flying alone. I remember getting out of the car at the airport was more difficult than saying byes to Mom and Dad over the summer, and I just can't explain why. Burbank Airport has that retro brown feel, which I don't really like. I bought a copy of the New Yorker and sat down, waiting for the plane. 7:05 flight, needless to say, wasn't too full. Rode the 8:22 bus to Davis, waited at the MU for AM and S to come, and then L and K and S and S and S and C and D. Had breakfast with a few of them, R came. Tried to visit the lab with K but ended up getting a sweatshirt instead and getting picked up by a white van (R, thank God) to go to the Graduate. Lunch there, met up with M and V and everyone else, I guess. A didn't show up, and I'm sad. Apparently Greyhounding didn't work too well for him.  Everyone's still the same, which disappoints me. C and D are still close friends, R and S (who dyed her hair and got braces) are still so tight that their circle excludes all other YSPers except, maybe, the twins. M is still shy, AM and S still combine forces for an overwhelming silliness (strange for girls who are probably going to Stanford and Harvard, respectively) and that cliquey kind of feel that always makes you wonder if they're whispering something about you. Truthfully, I don't think I enjoyed that lunch very much. It was just them goofing off or K and M and S talking about Science Olympiad. The only appropriate response (since I couldn't come up with material for either SO or something outlandish to keep up with the girls) was to laugh. I can do that, but it just doesn't show that I'm on the same level as everyone else.  Well, I don't know what I was expecting, but it was still a weird feel. K and I walked the route from the MU (and Hunt, etc.) back to Tercero, which brought back so many memories for me. I just wish I had all the girls arranged in the halls again...that, I think, is the genuine YSP feel. I can just picture a Sunday morning and arranging to go to the Old Teahouse or something with I and S and L and K and M...that kind of thing, not a lunch with the soches.  And then K's mom R picked me up from the Graduate. I love her mom; she's the kind I want to have. She's been on all sorts of adventures, and apparently her mom didn't really take care of her so she decided to do a better job with K. It's funny--I could talk to her the whole entire time, from the Graduate to the B&N in Fairfield to Yo Sushi across from K's high school.  So we met up with K, who had her exchange student from MA and her friend S and other exchange students, I guess. Went to the mall, ate at Quizno's and Coldstone, got back to the airport. I guess words can't exactly describe that feel of that afternoon.  Saturday. MT in the morning. Baja Fresh with C at lunch, who told me I was weird...and he still won't tell me why. Practice at Harrison's sister's house, memorizing openings, setting socks on fire, coziness and loveliness. J told them about the J&C joke, and they still don't get it.  Haha, and here I don't feel like writing anymore because I need to memorize that opening and do Huck Finn and the chapter summary and everything in between, lol. Jack Johnson, here I come.

{"id": "blog_39", "src": "From  Loss and Gain   The first of the  urlLink two   urlLink novels  by Venerable John Henry Newman, C.O.  In this scene, the main character (Charles Reding) receives some news from a close friend (and fellow Oxford undergraduate), which shows a bit of the type of reaction someone who converted to Catholicism in 19th England could expect.....  'Charles had to pass a day or two at the house of a relative who lived a little way out of London. While he was there a letter arrived for him, forwarded from home; it was from Willis, dated from London, and announced that he had come to a very important decision, and should not return to Oxford. Charles was fairly in the world again, plunged into the whirl of opinions: how sad a contrast to his tranquil home! There was no mistaking what the letter meant; and he set out at once with the chance of finding the writer at the house from which he dated it. It was a lodging at the west-end of the town; and he reached it about noon.  He found Willis in company with a person apparently two or three years older. Willis started on seeing him.  'Who would have thought! what brings you here?'he said; 'I thought you were in the country.' Then to his companion, 'This is the friend I was speaking to you about, Morley. A happy meeting; sit down, dear Reding; I have much to tell you.'  Charles sat down, all suspense, looking at Willis with such keen anxiety that the latter was forced to cut the matter short. 'Reding, I am a Catholic.'  Charles threw himself back in his chair, and turned pale.  'My dear Reding, what is the matter with you? why don't you speak to me?'  Charles was still silent; at last, stooping forward, with his elbows on his knees, and his head on his hands, he said, in a low voice, 'Oh, Willis, what have you done?'  'Done?' said Willis; 'what  you  should do, and half Oxford besides. Oh, Reding, I'm so happy!'  'Alas, alas!' said Charles; 'but what is the good of my staying?-all good attend you, Willis; good-bye!'  'No, my good Reding, you don't leave me so soon, having found me so unexpectedly; and you have had a long walk, I dare say; sit down, there's a good fellow; we shall have luncheon soon, and you must not go without taking your part in it.' He took Charles's hat from him as he spoke; and Charles, in a mixture of feelings, let him have his way.  'Oh, Willis, so you have separated yourself from us for ever!' he said; 'you have taken your course, we keep ours: our paths are different.'  'Not so,' said Willis; 'you must follow me, and we shall be one still.'  Charles was half offended. 'Really I must go,' he said, and he rose; 'you must not talk in that manner.'  'Pray, forgive me,' answered Willis; 'I won't do so again; but I could not help it; I am not in a common state, I'm so happy!'  A thought struck Reding. 'Tell me, Willis,' he said, 'your exact position; in what sense are you a Catholic? What is to prevent your returning with me to Oxford?'  His companion interposed: 'I am taking a liberty, perhaps,' he said; 'but Mr. Willis has been regularly received into the Catholic Church.'  'I have not introduced you,' said Willis. 'Reding, let me introduce Mr. Morley; Morley, Mr. Reding. Yes, Reding, I owe it to him that I am a Catholic. I have been on a tour with him abroad. We met with a good priest in France, who consented to receive my abjuration.'  'Well, I think he might profitably have examined into your state of mind a little before he did so,' said Reding; 'you are not the person to become a Catholic, Willis.'  'What do you mean?'  'Because,' answered Reding, 'you are more of a Dissenter than a Catholic. I beg your pardon,' he added, seeing Willis look up sharply, 'let me be frank with you, pray do. You were attached to the Church of Rome, not as a child to a mother, but in a wayward, roving way, as a matter of fancy or liking, or (excuse me) as a greedy boy to something nice; and you pursued your object by disobeying the authorities set over you.'  It was as much as Willis could bear; he said he thought he recollected a text about 'obeying God rather than men'.  'I see you have disobeyed men,' retorted Charles; 'I trust you have been obeying God.' '", "annotations": [{"summary_1": "In this scene, the main character receives some news from a close friend.

{"id": "cnndm_099292f247b89044dd94f1d42eda7687be0dec66", "src": "(CNN)A Columbia University student who was accused of rape is suing the New York City school for allowing his accuser to publicly brand him a \"serial rapist\" According to the lawsuit, Paul Nungesser was cleared of responsibility in Emma Sulkowicz's 2013 rape claim, as well as others that came to light after Sulkowicz went public with her allegations in various media interviews. Her case drew national attention after she started carrying a mattress around campus to protest the school's handling of the complaint, saying she hoped to show how \"flawed\" the university disciplinary system is when it comes to sexual misconduct cases. CNN does not usually name individuals in sexual assault cases, but in this instance, both parties have spoken publicly about their experience. They have also both said in separate interviews with The New York Times that Nungesser was cleared of responsibility in a disciplinary hearing. Nungesser, an international student from Germany, filed a federal discrimination lawsuit last week against the school; its president, Lee Bollinger; and the visual arts professor who oversaw Sulkowicz's mattress project, \"Carry That Weight,\" as part of her senior thesis. The lawsuit alleges the defendants violated Nungesser's right to an education free of gender-based discrimination by allowing Sulkowicz to speak out against him after he had been cleared of wrongdoing. During an April 2014 news conference at Columbia University, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand stood alongside Sulkowicz as she called Nungesser a \"serial rapist\" and said she fears for her safety while he's still on campus. The harassment continued, the lawsuit claims, when Columbia visual arts professor Jon Kessler let Sulkowicz \"transform her personal vendetta\" into a \"Columbia-sponsored calumny\" by supporting \"Carry That Weight\" for her senior thesis, allowing her to earn school credit through \"this outrageous display of harassment and defamation.\" Bollinger also commented on the case in a 2014 New York Magazine profile of Sulkowicz, now a senior at Columbia. \"This is a person who is one of my students, and I care about all of my students. And when one of them feels that she has been a victim of mistreatment, I am affected by that. This is all very painful.\" The defendants \"had the power, as well as the legal and contractual obligation\" to protect Nungesser, who is also a senior, the lawsuit claims. \"By refusing to protect Paul Nungesser, Columbia University first became a silent bystander and then turned into an active supporter of a fellow student's harassment campaign by institutionalizing it and heralding it.\" Columbia University declined to comment on the lawsuit. The school also declined to confirm the outcome of Nungesser's disciplinary proceedings. \"As we have said consistently, we do not and have not commented on individual students or disciplinary cases not only because of federal student privacy law, but also because of our ethical responsibility to ensure all current and future students have confidence that the university will never publicly discuss private matters they share when interacting with counselors and support staff, the campus disciplinary process or other resources we provide to them,\" spokesman Robert Hornsby said in statement. Kessler also declined to comment on the lawsuit. The case has produced dueling narratives from both sides in national media outlets. The most recent came from Nungesser in a Daily Beast article titled, \"Columbia Student: I Didn't Rape Her,\" in which he shared a long exchange of Facebook messages to support his claim that their sex was consensual. Some of those exchanges were included in the lawsuit, but Sulkowicz told CNN they were taken out of context in the suit. She also balked at the idea that Nungesser would sue the school or her professor \"for allowing me to make an art piece.\" \"It's ridiculous that he would read it as a 'bullying strategy,' especially given his continued public attempts to smear my reputation, when really it's just an artistic expression of the personal trauma I've experienced at Columbia,\" Sulkowicz wrote in an email. \"If artists are not allowed to make art that reflects on our experiences, then how are we to heal?\" The project essentially consists of Sulkowicz carrying a twin-size mattress wherever she goes on campus, but not off campus. She's allowed to accept help carrying the object but does not allow herself to ask for help.\u200b .

{"id": "cnndm_0a5c5a5f92c35ec03cd42feee53474d4164cbf33", "src": "Tokyo (CNN)A Japanese court has issued a landmark injunction halting plans to restart two nuclear reactors in the west of the country, citing safety concerns, a court official told CNN. Japan's nuclear watchdog, the Nuclear Regulation Authority, had previously given a green light to the reopening of reactors 3 and 4 of the Kansai Electric Power Company's Takahama nuclear plant. But locals successfully petitioned the court in Fukui Prefecture, where the plant is located, raising concerns about whether the reactors would survive a strong earthquake. Japan's 48 nuclear reactors are offline in the wake of the Fukushima disaster in 2011, when a tsunami triggered by a massive earthquake sent a wall of water crashing into the power plant. Since then, the island nation has imported greater amounts of expensive natural gas and coal to meet its energy needs. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has pushed for a return to nuclear energy, arguing it is essential to the country's economic recovery to reduce the skyrocketing utility bills associated with energy imports. But opinion polls have consistently shown public opposition to a nuclear restart. Keith Henry, managing director of Tokyo-based Asia Strategy, which advises businesses on Japanese public policy issues, says the decision will force Abe to rethink the economics of his energy policy. \"That was a body blow [for Abe] because it's no longer a political issue, it's a legal issue. It changes the calculus and the dynamics,\" he said. \"It's now in the courts. And the government is powerless to do anything about it.\" READ MORE: Power company abandons robot stranded inside Fukushima plant . Anti-nuclear activists celebrated following the Fukui District Court's decision in their favor Tuesday. The nuclear plant operator had argued in court that the plant was safe, meeting heightened safety regulations introduced by the nuclear watchdog following the Fukushima disaster. It said in a statement that \"scientific and professional findings\" showed that the safety of the reactors was assured. But the court ruled that the new safety standards were \"loose,\" lacked rationality and could not guarantee the safety of the plant, an official said. The power company said it would appeal the decision. \"We deeply regret that our assertion was not well comprehended, and cannot accept it at all,\" it said in a statement. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters Tuesday that the country's nuclear watchdog had deemed the plant safe according to the \"world's strictest\" safety standards. The government had no intention to change course on its planned nuclear restart, he said. Takahama was one of two nuclear facilities granted approval to resume operations. Sendai nuclear power plant in Kagoshima Prefecture has been granted approval to reopen by the prefecture's governor, although local residents are seeking to challenge this in court. Analyst Henry said the renewable energy sector could benefit from the Takahama decision, as the country weighed solar and hydro power as alternatives. Prior to the Fukushima disaster, about 30% of Japan's energy was nuclear generated.

{"id": "cnndm_0281c649039f99af337e91190d5bdcb5e9734969", "src": "London (CNN)British police investigating a spectacular heist in the heart of London's jewelry district said Friday they knew a burglar alarm went off but didn't respond. Southern Monitoring Alarm Company called the Metropolitan Police Service, also known as Scotland Yard, at 12:21 a.m. April 3 to report that the burglar alarm had been activated at Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd., MPS said in a prepared statement. \"The call was recorded and transferred to the police's CAD (computer-aided dispatch) system,\" the statement said. \"A grade was applied to the call that meant that no police response was deemed to be required. We are now investigating why this grade was applied to the call. This investigation is being carried out locally. \"It is too early to say if the handling of the call would have had an impact on the outcome of the incident.\" The theft was so big that police haven't come up with a value for what was stolen. Over the four-day Easter holiday, thieves broke into the vault of Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd. and might have been able to take as long as four days to rifle through the boxes. A former police official in London has speculated that the loss could run to \u00a3200 million, or $300 million, in a remark widely reported by news media. Numerous British news organizations put the value of the loss in the hundreds of thousands of pounds. Detective Chief Inspector Paul Johnson of the London Metropolitan Police Flying Squad said police were still identifying the owners of ransacked safe deposit boxes and trying to contact them to learn what had been lost. The British tabloid The Daily Mirror claimed Friday to have obtained closed-circuit TV footage that captured the robbery being carried out. The video showed people inside the building dressed like utility workers with their faces covered. They carried large bags, what looked like drill equipment and other tools, then exited with trash bins. Toward the end of the video, a white van can be seen on a street during daytime with individuals loading back their gear and the trash bins. British police told CNN they have not released any video of the heist. When asked about the video published by the Daily Mirror, police said they could not confirm that it was footage from the Hatton Garden robbery and that officers have not seen that particular video. The Daily Mirror published time-stamped images it said showed that the thieves had been -- as was feared -- in the vault for days. The Mirror's time stamps, which CNN has not been able to independently verify, show employees locking up for the weekend at 9:19 p.m. on Thursday. If the footage, and its interpretation by the newspaper are correct, at least six people were involved in the heist . Just four minutes later, the first of the thieves, nicknamed \"Mr. Ginger\" by the newspaper for his red hair, appears in the building holding a black bag. He goes downstairs toward the vault. At 9:27 p.m., a street camera shows a white Ford Transit van pulling up to an alley beside the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit building. Men are seen dragging trash bins down the alley before the van drives away, leaving the men behind. Inside the building, at 9:30p.m., the camera records a thief nicknamed \"The Gent\" for his natty clothing -- though he also wears a hard-hat and a high-visibility jacket labeled \"Gas\" on the back. A minute later, \"Mr. Strong\" appears, wearing a builder's hat and carrying steel supports, which the newspaper speculates could have been used to support the diamond-tipped drill used to smash through the wall of the vault. At 9:36 p.m., Mr. Strong and a thief nicknamed Mr. Montana for the logo on his hooded sweatshirt roll in trash bins, one of which might have contained, according the Mirror, the 77-pound drill that bored through the reinforced seven-foot concrete wall to reach the vault. It is unclear, but the thieves may have spent the night in the basement in or near the vault. At any rate, according to the Daily Mirror, no more activity is seen above ground until Friday morning, shortly before 8:00. The white van returns, is loaded in two minutes, and drives off again. On Saturday evening, Mr. Ginger returns, two days after he was first seen. The newspaper says is wearing latex gloves and carrying a black sack. He goes downstairs toward the vault. Saturday evening also marked the first appearance of the Tall Man, who helped carry some of the loot out of the building. Early Sunday, Mr Ginger, the Tall Man and a robber nicknamed the Old Man are seen to be active. The Tall Man and the Old Man struggle to move a bin before they drag it outside. The Old Man leans on the bin, struggling for breath, and reveals the side of his face to the camera. A white van arrives by the alley and the men start loading equipment on it, including several trash bins. Three men get into the white van and, at 6:44 a.m. they are gone. The heist would not be reported to police for two more days, on Tuesday morning when employees of the company arrived for work. Police said Thursday there was no sign of forced entry. Johnson said the thieves appeared to have gained access to the vault through the shaft of an elevator that is used by several businesses in the building. The thieves disabled the elevator on the second floor of the building -- which would be called the third floor in the United States -- then climbed down the elevator shaft into the basement, he said. Once there, he said, they used a drill to bore through a 6-foot-thick wall and gain access to the vault where the safe deposit boxes were. People with knowledge of the area have speculated that cash and jewels were probably taken. Some jewelry businesses reportedly stored some of their jewels in the boxes rather than leaving it in their stores over the holiday weekend. Johnson said the scene in the vault remained chaotic as police continued their forensic examination. He said the floor was covered with dust and littered with safe deposit boxes and power tools. WATCH: Top five jewelry heists . Johnson called the crime sophisticated and said there were a limited number of people in the United Kingdom capable of pulling it off. He said he had no idea whether the thieves were still in the country. Although there was no sign of forced entry to the building, the detective said, \"whether that involves inside knowledge will form part of the investigation.\" Hatton Garden is a storied area in London and the heart of the city's diamond trade. The area's promotional website says it is home to \"the largest and most concentrated cluster of jewellery retailers in the UK\" and has been for quite some time. \"History tells us that the old City of London had certain streets -- or quarters -- dedicated to specific types of business,\" the website says. \"The Hatton Garden area has been the epicentre of London's jewellery trade since medieval times. \"Today, it maintains its international reputation as the centre of London's diamond trade. It is one of the finest and most renowned jewellery locations in the world.\" How was $4.8 million in gold swiped from a North Carolina highway?

{"id": "cnndm_0ad6e0e18918f8ea0c33ac3f4b07f791bfc5929b", "src": "(CNN)Feidin Santana, the man who recorded a South Carolina police officer fatally shooting a fleeing, unarmed man, told CNN on Thursday night he was told by another cop to stop using his phone to capture the incident. \"One of the officers told me to stop, but it was because I (said) to them that what they did it was an abuse and I witnessed everything,\" he told CNN's \"Anderson Cooper 360\u02da.\" Santana told Cooper an officer told him to wait where he was but eventually he left the scene to go to work. In other interviews, Santana has said he feared for his life, which almost kept him from revealing the recording. Santana recalled the moments when he recorded a roughly three-minute video of North Charleston Police officer Michael Slager shooting Walter Scott as Scott was running away Saturday. That evidence led to the officer's firing and arrest on a murder charge. Santana said when he first came on the scene while walking to his job he saw Slager on top of Scott, who was on the ground. He could hear the sound of a Taser in use. At no time did Santana see Scott go after the Taser. He believes Scott was trying to get away. \"Mr. Scott never tried to fight,\" Santana told CNN. Police said Slager used a Taser against Scott, but Slager would also later tell a dispatcher that Scott at some point had grabbed the Taser. After Slager shot Scott five times, the officer went back to pick up something. Santana thinks it was the Taser but said he wasn't 100% sure what it was. Neither the struggle nor the use of a Taser was captured on video, because Santana had yet to begin recording. What we know about Officer Slager . The cell phone video, which Santana revealed this week, reignited national outcries surrounding police treatment of African-Americans and led to a murder charge against Slager, who is white. Scott was black. Police said Slager pulled the 50-year-old Scott over for a nonworking brake light on Saturday morning. Scott, according to a dash cam video, fled from Slager for unexplained reasons, and the officer chased him on foot. When Santana's video begins, Scott starts running away from the officer, with Scott's back to Slager. The video shows Slager shooting at Scott eight times before Scott falls down. Who was Walter Scott? Scott's mother, Judy Scott, told Cooper this week that she would want to thank Santana for coming forward. \"He was there. God planned that. He's the ram in the bush -- I truly believe that,\" Judy Scott said. Santana agreed. \"I think she was right,\" he said. \"God put me there for a reason.\" Judy Scott said she couldn't watch the whole recording. \"When I saw my son running and I saw the policeman behind him, I couldn't take it,\" she said. \"I had to turn away. I couldn't handle it. In an interview with NBC's Matt Lauer, Santana suggested that he was giving media interviews in part to protect himself against retribution. \"At some point I thought about staying anonymous, and don't show my face, don't talk about it. But ... if I wouldn't show my face, everybody over there knows, including the police, who I am,\" Santana said. Santana did not say whether he had received threats. His attorney, Todd Rutherford, said Santana's video would be useful in an investigation -- not only into the shooting but also into whether Scott received prompt medical attention. In the last half of the video, a second officer appears to examine Scott with gloved hands. Witness video, official accounts raise questions . Santana said after he stopped recording, he watched for a few more minutes but never saw anyone perform CPR. A police report says a third officer -- not shown in the video -- reported seeing an officer administering first aid, and that the third officer approached and helped that person \"with first aid and CPR.\" On Wednesday, asked whether CPR was performed on Scott, North Charleston police Chief Eddie Driggers said: \"In the end of it (the video), what I saw was (what I) believed to be a police officer removing the shirt of the individual and performing some type of life-saving (procedure), but I'm not sure what took place there.\" A timeline of events .

{"id": "cnndm_0408464fb6eb2702626d2ca1cbb7c28e76ddd255", "src": "(CNN)We did it again, in another American city. We set Baltimore on fire this time. We brutalized black bodies. We turned a funeral into a riot. We let things get out of hand. We looted. We threw stones at policemen. We threw stones at citizens. We created camera-ready chaos, and we replayed the images. We created a culture of such deep distrust and disrespect that violence seemed the inevitable response. We let the violence flow. We let the violence stand for everything that's wrong with the things we already didn't like. By now you may be asking, \"Who's we?\" You may be saying with some irritation, \"Don't lump me in with them. I didn't have anything to do with it.\" To which the only real answer can be: Stop kidding yourself. The word \"we\" is one of the great American words. We the People. Yes we can. We are family. I use \"we\" a lot when I talk about our country's achievements. I like to say we won the Second World War, we put a man on the moon, we invented the Internet, we gave the world jazz. Well, if I -- a son of immigrants whose family had nothing to do with any of those accomplishments -- if I get to claim those aspects of American history, then surely I have to claim the unsavory aspects too. \"We\" cuts both ways. We enslaved Africans. We cut Reconstruction short and made a mockery of equal citizenship. We supported Jim Crow, then redlined, subordinated, and ghettoized African-Americans. We cut blacks out of the New Deal. We created a polity in which racial inequity and economic inequality magnify each other unrelentingly. We tried to put a lid on it with heavy policing and a War on Drugs. We failed. We are the authors of every page of Baltimore's story. Don't tell me it's not your responsibility or mine. About how slavery and its legacy are artifacts of a time past. Someone else's problem. No, we own them all. And we all have to face that before we can fix anything in Baltimore or beyond. But there's another dimension of the story of \"we\" that matters as well. It's about progressives and conservatives and their competing stories of how we got here. Every time protests and violence break out in response to police brutality, the same depressing pattern breaks out. The event becomes simply a Rorschach test for left and right, and each side sees in the rioting confirmation of its prior views. For the left, it's about the deep structural root causes of the alienation and violence. Liberals gravitate on social media to commentaries or reactions that reinforce this frame, like the surprisingly astute comments from the Baltimore Orioles executive who spelled out why a long history of racial injustice and economic disenfranchisement made rioting nearly inevitable. Conservatives gravitate to their own frames, about a lack of personal responsibility or role models among poor urban blacks, about the failures of Great Society and Democratic programs, and about how it all comes back to a president (who happens to be black) who has divided us by focusing so much on race. What gets lost in this Groundhog Day replay of left-right frames is a simple reality that we all have to recognize: Both longstanding structural racism and personal irresponsibility are on display this week. Both a history of police brutality and a present crisis of street violence. Both an inherited, multigenerational lack of opportunity and a dearth of leaders willing to address it. We cannot separate out the aspects of the problem that don't fit our preferred explanation -- not if we are sincere about solving the problem. And until more people can see this, we will not see progress. We can't judge looters for their antisocial behavior without judging a color-caste structure and a school-to-prison pipeline that has flushed them away like so much refuse. By the same token, we can't keep opining about root causes without also supporting the parents and pastors and neighbors who, in their own small ways, are organizing each other to break the cycle of brokenness. I'm of the left. But it cannot possibly be that only those with whom I disagree are responsible for what is happening in Baltimore. It cannot possibly be that only my worldview contains all the solutions. Whatever our political perspective, we need to open our eyes to what is actually happening in Baltimore and other cities in the United States in the second decade of the 21st century. It is an abomination. We should all be able to say that. It's time to push each other out of our ideological and identity comfort zones and build unlikely coalitions to create more opportunity. It's time to act like we are all in charge. Because we are. And there is no other \"we\" waiting in the wings.", "annotations": [{"summary_1": "LZ Granderson: We are the authors of every page of Baltimore's story.

I am quite bored even though I have homework to attend to so I thought I might blog about my nothing day. I went to sleep last night like 1:45ish reading this really stupid book called, 'The Good Earth'. It is just about chinese sluts and how old 75 year old people get it on with 18 year olds. It is really messed up. Well so then I woke up at 5:30 and took a shower. I went back to bed and slept ten minutes. About now it was 5:50 and I went downstairs. Packed my backpack and then packed my lunch. I had my healthy breakfast of..Lucky Charms and then I realized I had to wear the Reel Big Fish T-shirt today so I quickly ran upstairs and changed. Then I went back Downstairs and brushed my teeth. I rode the bus and listened to beatles reading that same freaken book. Then I got to school. Made sure I did my physics lab report right then went up to my geometry class room and read that FRIKEN book until class started. We are doing stupid MAD easy trig Functions (sine. cosine. tangent) and stuff with vectors. DAMN is it easy. Then I went to Earth Science and typed up the questions for the whole class on the computer since I was the fastest and most Agile Typist. Then I travelled to physics and learned more about simple machines and how that all shiz works. I went on the bus and started reading that silly book AGAIN. (while listening to beatles) Then when I got to the school I realized sometimes I get carsick when i Read in the car. I suddenly felt really sick and there was a pain in my stoumache and I felt like throwing up. I went inside signed in and went to lunch and ate huriddly. I felt better Food is a Friend. Hmm. Then I went to civics and told about my current event witch was about radioactive mosquitos and how people die from malaria every 20s and so then I travelled to English and learned about the English books I have to read over the summer. In spanish we spoke english and learned about some weird language... I forget what it is called... something starting with span and ending with ish. O yea SPANGLISH! I went to track afterschool still no vaulting and so I ran Sun Valley and did the accelerations. I don't really want to run the 2 mile tomarrow. I have a feeling I am going to do REALLY bad. Anyhow I came home REALLY tired from this exciting hard day at school and so I eat food then feel asleep until 6:22. I got up put on my boyScout Uniform and went to some cross over thing for people turning into boy scouts. Then I walked to CVS sorry Straub it was closer than Rite-Aid. Bought three candy bars.. One for me...One for me... and One for my sister since she got straight A's on her report card. She did a HELL of a lot better than me. I came home ate 2 plate full of nachos I made and then came up to my room and decided I am bored lets BLOG! I am waiting for kevin and erika to blog and I though people might blog today but I guess I will be the first and only. I am downloading like 100000 CSI tv shows to watch and I LOVE that show. I am really bored so I should stop rambling. NO ONE wants to read this. I am a looser. I wish I had a girlfriend sometimes. I dono I just LONG for it then there are other time and I am like heh... Why WOULD I want one. But yea like I said I am rambling and no one likes me anyhow so I don't gotta worry about that. Sorry for boring you and wasting 5 min.

{"id": "cnndm_05ba1b21844a6c8664725b00e12232f8efae6bcb", "src": "London (CNN)The Hatton Garden heist, as it will surely come to be known, was every safe deposit box holder's nightmare, every movie director's dream. Thieves using heavy cutting equipment and rappelling gear broke into the vault of an esteemed 60-year-old safe deposit company in the heart of London over the past holiday weekend, possibly taking advantage of as many as four days to rifle through an uncounted number of safe deposit boxes. And they reportedly got away with hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of gems and cash -- even, in the educated guess of one former police official, as much as 200 million pounds, or $300 million. Police were offering few details Wednesday of the robbery at Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd. Detectives on the scene were carrying out a \"slow and painstaking\" forensic examination, police said in a statement. \"Officers anticipate the process to take approximately two days,\" the statement said. \"At this stage it is believed that approximately 60-70 safe deposit boxes were opened during the burglary. Officers are working closely with Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd to establish the identities of those affected. Police will be contacting victims directly as and when they are identified.\" WATCH: Top five jewelry heists . Throughout the day Wednesday, customers of the business went in and out of the premises, clearly unhappy about not being able to learn whether their boxes were among those ransacked. Hatton Garden is a storied area in London and the heart of the city's diamond trade. The area's promotional website says it is home to \"the largest and most concentrated cluster of jewellery retailers in the UK\" and has been for quite some time. \"History tells us that the old City of London had certain streets -- or quarters -- dedicated to specific types of business,\" the website says. \"The Hatton Garden area has been the epicentre of London's jewellery trade since medieval times. \"Today, it maintains its international reputation as the centre of London's diamond trade. It is one of the finest and most renowned jewellery locations in the world.\" $4.8M in gold swiped from N.C. highway. But how? The police statement did not put a value on the amount of the haul. But numerous British news organizations put the figure in the hundreds of thousands of pounds, which translates into even more hundreds of thousands of dollars. Many of those who rent safe deposit boxes at the company are reportedly in the jewelry trade. But Roy Ramm, a former chief of the Flying Squad, an economic crime unit of London's Metropolitan Police Service, came up with a much higher guess. \"I would not be surprised, given where this one is, in Hatton Garden, if 200 million pounds is around about the amount stolen,\" Ramm said on BBC Radio 4. Because of the long Easter weekend, police did not hear of the robbery until Tuesday morning. This may prove to be an embarrassment, as the Telegraph newspaper reported that the alarm at the business sounded Friday but, as the front and back doors still appeared locked, no action was taken.

Caller:  \"Hello, I'm trapped in this plane and I called my job, but I'm in this plane.\" Operator:  \"You're where?\" Caller:  \"I'm inside a plane and I feel like it's up moving in the air.  Flight 448 can you please tell somebody (to) stop it.\" The frantic 911 call came just as the Alaska Airlines flight had taken off from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport on Monday afternoon.  The caller was a ramp agent who fell asleep in the plane's cargo hold. The cell phone call soon broke up, but the man was making himself known in other ways as the crew and passengers reported unusual banging from the belly of the Boeing 737. The pilot radioed air traffic control and said he would make an emergency landing. \"There could be a person in there so we're going to come back around,\" he told air traffic control. The ramp agent who took the untimely nap and caused all the fuss is an employee of Menzies Aviation, a contractor for Alaska Airlines that handles loading the luggage. He'll no longer have the option of dozing aboard one of the airline's planes. \"The Menzies employee has been permanently banned from working on Alaska Airlines planes,\" said Bobbie Egan, a spokeswoman for the airline. Flight 448, which was on its way to Los Angeles, only spent 14 minutes in the air. Other than being scared, the agent never was in any real danger. The cargo hold is pressurized and temperature controlled, the airline said. The passengers knew something wasn't right, almost as soon as the plane took off. \"All of a sudden we heard all this pounding underneath the plane and we thought there was something wrong with the landing gear,\" Robert Higgins told CNN affiliate KABC. Not everyone heard the banging, but it was soon clear this wasn't a normal flight. \"We just took off for L.A. regular and then ... about five minutes into the flight the captain came on and said we were going back and we'd land within five to seven minutes, and we did,\" passenger Marty Collins told affiliate KOMO. \"When we landed was when all the trucks and the police and the fire trucks surrounded the plane.\" \"I think it's scary and really unsafe, too,\" Chelsie Nieto told affiliate KCPQ. \"Because what if it's someone who could have been a terrorist?\" The employee started work at 5 a.m. and his shift was scheduled to end at 2:30 p.m., just before the flight departed. The agent was off the two days prior to the incident and had taken a lunch break and a break in the afternoon before making his way into the cargo hold, according to a source familiar with the investigation. The man had been on a four-person team loading baggage onto the flight. \"During a pre-departure huddle, the team lead noticed the employee was missing. The team lead called into the cargo hold for the employee and called and texted the employee's cell phone, but did not receive an answer. His co-workers believed he finished his shift and went home,\" the airline's blog said. It's believed he was hidden by luggage, making it difficult for the rest of his team to see him, the source said. All ramp employees have security badges, and undergo full criminal background checks before being hired, according to the airline. After the delay, the flight with 170 passengers and six crew members on board made it to Los Angeles a couple of hours late.

{"id": "cnndm_0bc55c4e3c651628ad0e409a8b7c15139a917e3e", "src": "Seoul (CNN)In the first few days after the Sewol disappeared beneath the Yellow Sea, divers pulled body after body from the watery wreckage, bringing the dead home. And throughout the following days, weeks and months, Park Eun-mi waited to see if one of them was her 16-year-old daughter, Huh Da-yun. The divers stopped searching months ago because of the winter and water conditions, and the South Korean ferry remains on the bottom of the sea floor. The Sewol sank on April 16, killing 304 people, mostly high school students who were on their way to a field trip to Jeju island, off South Korea's southern coast. \"We kept waiting with belief in finding our daughter. I thought once, 'Somebody will be the last person and what if it's Da-yun?'\" Park said. A year later, Park's life remains at a standstill. Nine have yet to be found. \"We, the families of the missing victims, are still living the day --  April 16, 2014,\" said Park, who is in poor health, but refusing treatment. \"I cannot think about anything except to find my daughter and other missing people.\" Park's case is an unsettling one -- emblematic of what remains unresolved a year after the Sewol ferry sank. Dozens associated with the ferry disaster have been sent to jail on criminal charges. But families say the underlying problems that led to the sinking of the Sewol are far from resolved. On April 16, the Sewol ferry, carrying hundreds of high school students, began sinking after taking a sharp turn. Passengers were told repeatedly by the crew members to stay where they were as rescuers would arrive soon. Many of them listened to the instructions and remained in place. As the ferry tilted sideways, water seeped in and objects in the ship toppled over, injuring people and blocking their way out. Anger over how the crew failed to evacuate the passengers intensified when video surfaced of the ferry's captain in his underwear leaping into the arms of the Korean Coast Guard while hundreds remained trapped in the vessel. Divers had to pluck the bodies from the water one-by-one, bringing the youngsters back to land in black body bags where they were met with the gut-wrenching cries of their families. On Thursday, the one year anniversary of the disaster, South Korea's President Park Geun-hye called for the salvage of the Sewol's wreck \"as soon as possible.\" \"Recently, there was an announcement that it is technically possible to salvage Sewol ferry. I believe that it is now time to earnestly prepare to salvage,\" she said. A government study on raising the ferry released last week identified a crane and floating dock as the safest way to look for the missing. The Sewol ferry is over 20 years old and there are fears it could fall apart during the extraction, according to the South Korean Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries. The agency anticipates a complicated technical operation to remove the ferry, which would weigh about 10,200 tons above water. The process could take over a year and a half, and that it would cost the South Korean government anywhere from $91 million to $182 million. The victims' families have demanded that the ship be recovered in order to thoroughly investigate the accident. Since the days immediately after the disaster, families have criticized the government over its response. Communication over the rescue efforts were jumbled, paving way for rumors and hoaxes. Criticism swirled over the South Korean Coast Guard's effectiveness in carrying out the rescue operation. The captain of the first coast guard ship sent to rescue the Sewol passengers was found guilty of negligence and making false reports. The recovery efforts have also taken a deadly toll with a total of six deaths -- a diver searching the Sewol died in May, and in July, five people died after a helicopter carrying emergency workers involved in the operation crashed. Park, the South Korean president, pledged major reforms, dismantled the coast guard and vowed an investigation into what went wrong. That promised investigation has been hampered by politics and disagreements between the families and the government over who should participate in the investigation. Earlier this month, several dozens of family members marched to Seoul from Ansan, the suburb where most of the students had resided. Some of the families shaved their heads to demand political action. Several laws have been passed to inspect cargo weight and increase oversight in the industry. In the case of Sewol, the ferry was found to be loaded with double its capacity. Its cargo wasn't secured properly, which threw the ship off balance as the containers tumbled and knocked the vessel off balance. An inexperienced crew and redesigns of the ship to handle more passengers and cargo were also cited as factors in the disaster. The sinking spurred a debate about the shortcomings of the government and what preventive measures should have been taken. \"The tragedy of Sewol was also virtually caused by accumulation of corruption, irregularity and going blind eyes,\" Park said on Thursday. \"Corruption and deep-rooted evil are issues that can lead to taking away people's lives. We take this very seriously.\" In the immediate aftermath, South Korean prosecutors arrested the captain, crew members and business associates. Sewol's captain, Lee Joon-seok, who was widely derided for jumping to safety, was sentenced to 36 years in prison for abandonment causing death and injury, and violating sea laws. In July, the body of a billionaire Yoo Byung Eun, who was believed to have connections to the company that owned the ferry, was found decomposing in a plum field. But some families say that wider, systematic problems that allowed the disaster to occur haven't been addressed.  Whether the ferry will be raised and an independent investigation will be held remains to be seen.

{"id": "cnndm_08ffdfdcd9c6a88aa6dc00aecd5003209e0bb894", "src": "(CNN)Talk show host Dr. Mehmet Oz is defending himself against a group of doctors who accuse him of \"manifesting an egregious lack of integrity\" in his TV and promotional work and who call his faculty position at Columbia University unacceptable. In a written statement issued last week, Oz said, \"I bring the public information that will help them on their path to be their best selves. We provide multiple points of view, including mine which is offered without conflict of interest.  That doesn't sit well with certain agendas which distort the facts. For example, I do not claim that GMO (genetically modified organism) foods are dangerous, but believe that they should be labeled like they are in most countries around the world. I will address this on the show next week.\" That show was taped on Tuesday and in a clip posted online after the taping, he tells his audience he will not be silenced. The episode will air on Thursday afternoon in most markets, Friday in others. It all started when a group of 10 physicians from across the country emailed a letter to Columbia University expressing disapproval that Oz is on the faculty. The email sent to Columbia's faculty dean for Health Sciences and Medicine, Dr. Lee Goldman, said the group is \"surprised and dismayed\" that Oz is on faculty and that he holds a senior administrative position. Oz is vice chair of the Department of Surgery, at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. The email was sent by Dr. Henry Miller, a fellow in scientific philosophy and public policy at Stanford University's Hoover Institute. It was signed by nine other physicians from across the country, none of whom is affiliated with Columbia. They accuse Oz of what they call \"manifesting an egregious lack of integrity by promoting quack treatments and cures in the interest of personal financial gain.\" They go on to say Oz has \"either outrageous conflicts of interest or flawed judgments about what constitutes appropriate medical treatments, or both.\" The doctors argue in their emailed letter that Oz shows \"disdain for science and for evidence-based medicine, as well as baseless and relentless opposition to the genetic engineering of food crops.\" It's worth noting that Miller previously worked at the FDA, at one point reviewing genetically engineered drugs. As an example, they cite an investigation reported on the show in 2011 in which apple juice was presented as having unsafe levels of arsenic. The FDA disputed the findings and said the report was misleading and irresponsible. This is not the first time Oz has been called out. He was in the hot seat on Capitol Hill at a June 2014 hearing on false advertising for deceptive weight loss products featured on his show. Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri, and chairwoman of the Senate Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety and Insurance, said at the hearing he was perpetuating scams, whether it was intentional or not. Miller and the other doctors who signed the email echo that sentiment, saying Oz is misleading the public and they tell Columbia's Goldman that having him on the faculty is unacceptable. The doctors, who are in different areas of the country and different facets of the medical community, all have a connection to Miller although they do not all know each other. CNN has reached out to all of them. Those who have responded say Miller invited them to sign the email. Orlando, Florida, anesthesiologist Dr. Shelley Fleet told CNN when she received an email from Miller inviting her to sign the email to Columbia, she said of course. \"He's a charlatan, and Columbia elevating him to a position of authority is a credence and platform for misleading more people,\" she said in a phone interview. Fleet was a classmate of Miller's at MIT. Dr. Joel Tepper, a radiology professor at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, is also a former classmate of Miller's. He told CNN he does not have a vendetta against Oz. He said he just wants him to \"follow the basic rules of science and state what he knows as fact as fact and state what he doesn't know as fact as not fact.\" He and Fleet share McCaskill's example of Oz's promotion of \"miracle weight loss drugs\" on the show as failure on Oz's part to follow the oath taken by doctors to do no harm. Dr. Gordon Gill, professor emeritus of medicine and of cellular and molecular medicine at the University of San Diego School of Medicine, wrote in a letter to CNN: \"In discussions with Henry, I agreed that the imprimatur of Columbia Medical School behind Dr. Oz gave an inaccurate message to TV viewers and as Dr. Goldman and I are long time colleagues I was comfortable pointing out these problems to him.\" Miller worked in Gill's research lab before he went to medical school. While the email does not call for any specific action to be taken by the university, Miller told CNN in an email that the group's goal is \"for Dr. Oz to resign from the Columbia faculty and decide that he'd prefer a career as a TV celebrity doctor.\" Oz spokesman Tim Sullivan sent an email to CNN last week listing the names of five of the 10 people who complained about Oz. The email questions the integrity and even the qualifications of those who are pointing fingers at Oz. For its part, Columbia University is standing by Oz. Spokesman Doug Levy said in a statement, \"Columbia is committed to the principle of academic freedom and to upholding faculty members' freedom of expression for statements they make in public discussion.\" Levy added that the university's role is to foster research, and it will not take action that hinders public statements by faculty members. The university has no position on what faculty members say in public discussion -- that is their individual academic freedom and is provided to them in the university's governing documents, he said. A cardiac surgeon, Oz came to Columbia for his residency after medical school in 1986 and rose through the ranks. He is also the director of the Cardiovascular Institute and Complementary Medicine program at New York Presbyterian Hospital. Oz rose to fame after frequent appearances on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" led to the creation of his own show and magazine. He is also co-founder of the consumer health website Sharecare.com.

And thinking about all the crushes I have had in the past.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Pretty much from&nbsp;at the same time&nbsp;I met Krysten, I met someone else who became the ultimate crush from afar.&nbsp; First, let me explain what exactly a crush from afar is... It is someone who you don't really know.&nbsp; You may know them socially, or you may not even know their name.&nbsp; But the main point is,&nbsp;you've never had a conversation with them.&nbsp; Thats whats so great about a crush from afar.&nbsp; You are able to turn the person into whatever you want them to be. You run into them out, randomly.&nbsp; You slowly learn bits and pieces from other people.&nbsp; eventually you'll probably meet, and thats where it ends.&nbsp; Because usually a crush from afar is so great until they talk, but by then you expect so much from them, that they can't live up to it, and you are left un impressed.&nbsp; unhealthy? yes.&nbsp; fun? you betcha.(until the end at least, and writing all that down makes it all seem very trivial and mean)&nbsp; Does this make any sense?&nbsp; Let me explain my first crush from afar and see if that helps.  &nbsp;  Sophomore year of college, I am dating this guy ARM.&nbsp; He is much, much older, knows everyone, and gets me into 21 and up places.&nbsp; (A pretty good guy, we are still friends, although his girlfriend isn't a fan of me.)&nbsp; One night when I met Arm at Ptar, I notice there are three girls from my high school there.&nbsp; I go over, sit down, say hi.&nbsp; A few minutes later this guy walks up, sort of introduces himself, starts talking to the other girls, I wander off.&nbsp; So the next night at Carneys, after Amy tried to make me change clothes, we met up with ARM and Amy's boy.&nbsp; Right before the bar closes, I notice this guy looking at me, turns out it is the guy from before.&nbsp; I yell out, 'Hey I know you.'&nbsp; Motion for him to come over and introduce him to everyone.&nbsp; Turns out he already knows everyone.&nbsp; He sits down and is just staring at me.&nbsp; Finally right before we leave, he takes my hand tells me I am the most beautiful girl he has ever seen and can we just hang out sometime.&nbsp; Amy and I start laughing, from shock mostly, I hurriedly write down my number and take off.&nbsp; Of course, he never calls.&nbsp; So began my first crush from afar.  &nbsp;  Though the grapevine we find out 1) he too is much older 2) he is friends with everyone I know 3) he isn't in school 4) he is a lead singer in a local band.&nbsp; So for about a 6 months, we, Krysten and I,&nbsp;would go to the shows, and jam out to the cover songs in the back.&nbsp; About a year after I first met him, we figured he couldn't recognize me and were enjoying the concerts front and center.&nbsp; And then two years later, we all (Me, Krysten, Jake, the crush and his bandmates) ended up sitting at a kitchen table together.&nbsp; When I actually started listening to the conversation, I was laughing at myself.&nbsp; Krys caught my eye from across the table and we both cracked up.&nbsp; Krys just kept egging them on.&nbsp; The conversation basically centered around them and how they could make raps about any ordinary thing, and how they were going to sell those jingles to become famous.&nbsp; 'How do you like your chicken cooked?'&nbsp; And or the next 6 months I thought I was such an idiot for ever thinking all those things about him.&nbsp; And then somehow, three years later, we all became close friends. (And until recently he didn't have any idea who I was, or if he did, he didn't let on.&nbsp; One night I brought it up, and we all just laughed.)  &nbsp;  So that was my first crush from afar.&nbsp; And I realized all my crushes have lead to good things.&nbsp; Scotty T and I became friends.&nbsp; Evan began as a crush from afar, but somehow fit into everything I wanted.&nbsp; Strange.&nbsp; Jamey began as a crush from work.&nbsp; China boy began as a crush from across the class room.&nbsp; ASheedy is the best crush ever, because I never know when he will show up, but it always turns out great.&nbsp; He is still a true crush with no real conversation.  &nbsp;  i ramble.&nbsp; alot.", "annotations": [{"summary_1": "This week I've been struggling with stress over starting law school and money.

{"id": "blog_9", "src": "I am in awe of God this afternoon. He never ceases to amaze me. He is so womderful. For the second week in a row, my youngest son and his family have been in church. They had stopped going for quite awhile. I know God is going to bring my middle son, his wife and my husband back as well. He promised me in Acts 16:31!  The last few weeks, there have been alot of questions about dreams in our Bible Study. I had a set of tapes about dreams and visions. So I thought I would listen to them, take notes and then share them in the Bible study. I have had a couple dreams myself, I would like to know the meaning of. I want to share them with you.  The first dream was my husband was driving a bus. He was acting crazy, I mean, literally insane. It was a yellow bus, so I assume it was a school bus. I was running down the sidewalk beside it trying to get him to stop. He was acting so weird. A lady in our church was riding on the bus with him. She was just sitting there with no concern to what was happening. Then I woke up. This was about a year ago and I haven't forgotten it. There have been times when my husband acts like he is crazy and I look around for that yellow bus! Just kidding!  The interpretation of this dream, according to the tapes I have been listening to would be this. You first see where you are in the dream. If you are watching events happen, if you are with others, participating the event or if you are the focus of the dream. In this case, I was with others. Any kind of transportation, bike, car, truck, bus, semi, plane, etc. would be a symbol for your ministry. The larger the vehicle, the larger the ministry. So the bus would be a pretty big ministry. Color is important. It was a yellow bus. Yellow is the symbol for fear. School bus would be a symbol for education. So here is what I get out of this dream. Whether it is correct or not, I don't really know but it does give me hope!  My husband gave his life to the Lord. This would be the 'crazy' part. He was sold out to God and was 'out of his mind'! He was fearful but he started a bus ministry, picking people up to take them to be educated. I was trying to get him to slow down because he was going faster than I was and I couldn't keep up. His ministry was getting ahead of me. I think I was the one who was doing the educating or discipling. He was picking them up and taking them to me. This would all seem very possible with the Dream Center I have on my heart to begin. So who but God knows what is about to happen!  The next dream, I had only a couple weeks ago. I was running and there was a bunch of yellow jacket bees on me. They were covering me. I was trying to yell for help but I couldn't yell. I saw this pond and I knew if I jumped in the water, the bees would drown. I jump in but I couldn't go under the water. It was deep but I lay on my stomach and only about half of me was in the water. It was like a wall of something stopping me from being able to get my whole body in it.  I was the focus of the dream here so it is about me. Bees are a symbol of demons. So I was being attacked by several demons, in all areas of my life, because they covered me. I couldn't yell symbolizes that I have not spent enough time in prayer. The water represents the Holy Spirit. The more water, i.e. sink, bathtub, pool, stream, river, pond, lake, sea, ocean, the more of the Holy Spirit you have in your life. A pond isn't a big body of water so I wasn't filled very much with the Holy Spirit and I couldn't fight off all the demons. I needed to pray more and be filled more with the Spirit. To be able to do more spiritual warfare and to be delivered from the demonic oppression. This fits exactly where I am at right now. So I think this dream interpretation is right on.  This study has been awesome. As I said, I don't know if all the symbols he gives on these tapes are right or not but I do know that the dream about the bees would hit me right between the eyes.", "annotations": [{"summary_1": "My youngest son and his family have been in church for the second week in a row.

{"id": "cnndm_07f60889bcd1f3d2c48b715220f13df8d2c5e158", "src": "(CNN)There's an old saying which states the Cape Verde Islands are home to a greater number of musicians per square kilometer than any other country in the world. In truth, such a definitive claim may be nigh on impossible to prove. But there is a certain factual accuracy behind the legend: the important and proud relationship the Atlantic island country of just 500,000 people has with music. Situated roughly 350 miles off the west coast of Africa, Cape Verde has long been a mesh of cultures, history and races. The former Portuguese territory was once a key location for the transatlantic slave trade, a target for 16th century pirates and a refuge for exiled Jews. From this diverse melting pot were born the unique sounds of the batuque, morna, funana and other distinct musical styles. Now, Cape Verde is seeking to tap-into the spoils of this rich cultural heritage in a bid to help its economy flourish. Bereft of oil, gas, gold, diamonds or the conventional natural resources that have fueled growth in many other African countries, Cape Verde has had to look for alternative sectors to aid its development. And what's more alternative than a jiving, swinging, musical economy? \"Besides fish, it is pretty common (for Cape Verde) to say 'our biggest richness is in music and culture,'\" said Christine Semba of Womex, an international networking platform for the world music genre. The economic potential of music has been also acknowledged  by Cape Verde's prime minister, Jose Maria Neves, while the country's ministry of culture is run by Mario Lucio de Sousa, himself a popular musician. \"The future of our country lies in our capacity to create, our capacity to innovate,\" Neves said in reference to the music and the arts at a World Trade Organization conference in 2013. Other elements of the creative economy include handicrafts, fashion and visual arts to name but a few. However, a 2013 report from the UN Conference on Trade and Development noted that Cape Verde's creative sector remained a relatively small part of its economy with much room for improvement and long term planning. But that doesn't mean there hasn't been some promising early signs that music has the potential to play a key role in the future. One early musical success has been the Kriol Jazz Festival. The event, which is celebrating its seventh edition, took place in the capital city of Praia this past weekend. Artists including Grammy-winning U.S. singer Esperanza Spalding have been invited to perform, as have acts from the likes of Luxembourg, Brazil and, of course, Cape Verde. According to Harold Taveres, a liaison to the mayor of Praia involved with promoting the festival, \"KJF has become one of the most spectacular events in Cape Verde. \"We breathe the music in Cape Verde, we live with the music,\" he added. \"Now the festival has brought people from every corner in the world (to share in this).\" During the festival, bars, hotels and restaurants are full to the brim while taxi drivers are seldom unable to find a fare during what locals refer to as \"the week of party.\" It's a lucrative trade, for sure. Yet in order to take full advantage of this bustling scene the country's ministry of culture, alongside some enterprising private sector figures, thought a deeper relationship with the music business was required. Enter the Atlantic Music Expo, a three-year-old conference and networking event that seeks to help Cape Verdean artists secure international exposure. This year's AME took place in the days before the Kriol Jazz Festival. Delegates, local musicians and their management teams were exposed to roundtables, workshops and talks on the intricacies of the global music business. \"We try to invite lots of producers and a lot of journalists from around the world to see the festival and the musicians from Cape Verde,\" said Jose Da Silva, long time manager of the late Cape Verdean songstress Cesaria Evora. Da Silva is one of the driving forces behind AME as well as being the founder of the Lusafrica and Harmonia record labels that aim to discover a new generation of artists from Cape Verde. He hopes that by exposing musicians to a range of experienced industry professionals and top-level musicians, they will become equipped with the tools and ambition to take the music of Cape Verde across the globe. Not only will this help launch the careers of artists and musicians (with all the respective behind the scenes business structures such developments require) but it will garner valuable attention for the country. This is where the greatest potential economic benefits lie. Tourism is expected to account for 20% of the country's GDP by 2024, according to research from the World Travel and Tourism Council. Getting Cape Verde's name out on the world stage through recognition of its rich musical culture is therefore increasingly important. \"Economically it's beneficial for the country because the money we would have to spend on the market to give the country this exposure in the world would be too big,\" Da Silva said. \"This way it costs less money.\" Semba agrees with this, and highlights the joined up thinking of the government and private sector actors like Da Silva for special praise. \"In the long term, the whole country is behind this event,\" Semba said, adding \"this is a very innovative approach which we would like to see in many more countries.\" It must be noted, however, that few countries have the same natural resources for music as Cape Verde.

{"id": "cnndm_06006791fe162901fe9b71dd82f598defc986050", "src": "(CNN)Much like the ardent young royal-watchers of today, enamored by the Duchess of Cambridge's very being, I was similarly captivated by Diana, Princess of Wales when I was a youngster. She was a rare breed: stunningly beautiful, immediately accessible, witty, charming and endearingly mischievous -- she was one in a million. Of course that was long before the, \"there were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded,\" interviews and tell-all books alleging suicide attempts and acts of betrayal, but back then I was unaware of her more scandalous infamy. I simply adored her ... I still do. As the world awaits the impending birth of William and Kate's second baby, potential names have become the topic of rampant speculation and heated debate. Girls' names are causing the biggest stir, as there seems to be a belief that the couple are expecting a princess. If the assumptions are correct, she will be the first Princess of Cambridge born into the royal family in 182 years. The birth of any baby is cause for celebration, but given recent changes in the laws of succession, her arrival would be a historical one. In choosing a name, titled royals tend to turn to the family tree, rather than a well-thumbed copy of \"1,001 Best Baby Names\" like the rest of us. Traditionally they pick dynastic names, and there are plenty to choose from: Elizabeth, Alice, Victoria and Charlotte have all been frontrunners, but the sentimental favorite among punters remains Diana. In a recent Today Show poll, 32% of Americans predicted the name was a shoo-in, and in the UK the bookies' odds of a baby named after her late grandmother change almost daily as Diana becomes an increasingly popular choice. That said, in the event the couple do welcome a baby girl, I would hope that they do not opt to name her Diana. Today Diana's name is as divisive as the very institution of monarchy itself: while some have virtually sainted her, others have been vehemently critical, accusing her of being childish, unhinged and self-serving. Contrary to popular belief the Queen was very fond of Diana, but should her name be bestowed as a first name upon the baby, it would be perceived as a slap in the face to the monarchy. In the years since Earl Spencer's scathing attack on the Windsors at Diana's funeral, the nation has moved on and Diana's legacy has been celebrated. She has become a part of royal history. Her memory has been preserved, and the royal family is once again enjoying a renewed sense of popularity. Out of respect to the Queen, Charles, Camilla and the baby herself the couple simply wouldn't do it. Diana's name conjures up both positive and negative responses the world over, and whichever side of the fence you're on, the moniker seems to me an almighty burden for a newborn baby to carry. Since Diana's death almost 18 years ago, William has honored his mother's memory in a private and personal fashion. He has taken on many of her patronages and continued to champion her causes. At his wedding in 2011 the Bishop of London, Richard Chartres, a close friend of Diana and executor of her will, gave the address. The hymn Guide Me O Thou Great Redeemer, which was sung at both Diana's funeral in 1997 and at the memorial marking the tenth anniversary of her death in 2007, was chosen for the royal wedding. Julia Samuel, another close friend of Diana, was asked to serve as Godmother to Prince George. William chose Kensington Palace, his own childhood home, to be the primary residence for his family, and in perhaps the most public acknowledgment of his mother's memory, he gave Kate Diana's engagement ring. William doesn't need to name his second-born child after his mother in order to honour her; he does so by being a good husband and father. I still miss Diana. She was a one-off, and I don't believe the world will ever witness another quite like her. Daily comparisons to her late mother-in-law are already Kate's cross to bear. Shouldn't a baby girl be spared the same fate? Diana's tragic, untimely death and iconic status will ensure her memory is kept alive for generations to come. She wouldn't want her granddaughter to languish in her shadow. She would want her to go out into the world, to make her own mark and help those less fortunate, to enrich the lives of others and to carve out her own unique identity -- as Alice, Elizabeth, Victoria, Charlotte, or -- my own personal pick -- Alexandra.", "annotations": [{"summary_1": "Diana, Princess of Wales, was a rare breed: stunning, accessible, witty, charming.

{"id": "blog_3", "src": "Mead Forest - Alti Lake          Verdant green gives way to brilliant skies of blue marked by the occasional puffy cloud that slowly floats across  the sea above. The forest has parted and the tall elms and oaks give way to smaller ash and the occasional shrub, the difference in height lending an appearance of homage paid. The creation to which such fealty and respect is paid is a simple lake that stretches off into the distance, but whose furtherest banks can still be glimpsed at the limits of one's sight.          The banks are marked by patches of nine o' tails and reeds that interrupt the lines of smooth earth worn so by  water and time. The croak of a frog and the cry of the birds above intermingle with the rough sounds of ducks and the buzzing of insects. Every so often, one catches sight of a shadow, small and undefined, sliding beneath the surface further from shore as well as the occasional glimpse of glittering silver scales. A sense of peace marks the scene, one that almost seems to make one desire to move on than stay and risk disturbing the tranquility of the lake's inhabitants.  Contents: Liv Polar-bear Jodie Kaze Matt Zoe Kasui Sylvan Obvious exits: North    Southwest    Polar-bear is looking at you.  Sylvan returns to Jodie's side, then ushers her and Kasui to follow her back home. She calls to Matt and the other, 'I hope we meet again and share a good meal and stories.'  Pobble trundles along, with a monkey sat on his shoulder. He seems mostly held up by his walking stick which isn't of the bought variety but of the 'picked up along the way to prevent falling over' kind. His expression is paradoxial, a conflict of hyperactivity and tiredness as if desparately wanting to lie down and sleep but being pulled along on some travel against his will.  Sylvan departs the well-worn paths of the lake area, disappearing into the thickets and brambles.  Sylvan has left.  Moving along an overgrown path, the Polar-bear ambles along at an easy gait. On his back, rides the lovely Liv. She grins widely, her fingers digging deeply down into the bear's thick fur and holding herself on.  Zoe nods to Sylvan as she leaves with the others, then turns when she hears the others, her face taking on an air of  disbelief. Do they never stop arriving to private property?? Yet, when the bear is spied, she smiles a touch, a hand  reaching out to touch Matt briefly to call attention, the dog at her feet growling before she gives another silent hand  command that hushes the beagle.  Jodie does proceed to follow Sylvan, giving her farewells to the others with a wave and a smile before turning to go  through the same opening in the brush Syl went through.  Matt quirks a brow, seeing the Polar bear and his rider. He looks at them curiously.  Polar-bear looks around at all the folks comming and going and staying. He wanders over to bump into Zoe. Not hard. Maybe a sort of polar bear version of 'Hey how are you?'. Then he stop. Hm. Pobble has his attention as the beast decides how he feels around one of these two legged things wearing so much white fur. And the monkey. It's ... bite sized. Yum.  Liv is looking at you.  Kasui pushes away from the tree as Sylvan urges her, apparently not having been so unalert after all. She says not a word as she follows Sylvan through the opening in the brush, merely giving Zoe and Matt a nod, thugh sh gives th epolar bear a sidelong glance before disappearing after her friend into the rushes...  Liv is just along for the ride. Her eyes get wide as she bear bumps into people.. and she ofers an appologetic smile as she says 'Hi.. uhm.. excuse us...' THe woman speak with a noticable norse sort of accent.  Zoe cannot help but smile at the bear, though she glances to Matt first before hse reaches out to give the huge animal a friendly scritch. Yeah, she's petting a polar bear. STrange things you see sometimes here in the woods. Lifting her gaze to the woman that rides the bear, she smiles, nodding to her, 'Good afternoon.. It is ok.' At least she's not been licked yet by fish-baited drooly tongue. Turning, she leans in to whisper something to Matt at her side.  Pobble stops dead in his tracks. He sways uncertainly, struggling against gravity. Eyes dart between those assembled, and the bear. The monkey seems edgy, tiny hands grabbing onto one of Pobble's braids and it lets out a quiet chitter. The blue haired yeti nods slowly. 'Eh. Sorry. I'm lost.. I was trying to get back to the picnic site?' His coat is pulled and torn, as are his pants. Leaves and bambles cling to the thick white fur. He does look in the 'lost and distraught' category.  Kaze is for his part still standing in the shadows at the edge of the treeline, seeming to slide easily from the mind's eye as he merely watches making no moves to call attention to himself.  Matt nods softly to something Zoe says to him.  Monkey ... so tastey ... The bear licks his lips and stares.  Liv notices where the bear is looking, and reaches out to bonk the white monster square between his ears with a fist!   'There'll be no eating of pets.' she states firmly.  Kasui has disconnected.  The Monkey also seems to notice the attention it's getting and slinks down into it's clothing before clambering behind   Pobble's head and dropping down into the oversized hood. The blue haired man hops from one foot to the other, apparently cold. Eyes with oversized pupils dart from one wood-lover to the next. 'Anyone able to direct me?'  Matt hmms. 'I'm sorry, what're you looking for?'  Zoe muffles a laugh at Liv's words to the bear, then falls silent as she turns to look at Pobble, curious and watchful of  the strange one with the monkey on his back. Oiy, that just makes her want to start singing for some reason.  Could just gobble him right up. Or maybe just half. Save the rest for ... Hey! THe bear crains his neck to see the woman on his back. He does his best to look wounded. Deeply. On a moraly and philosophical level. Then he bolts for the water, taking his passanger with him.  Kaze steps out from where he has been the entire time, only now coming into general notice stepping over near Pobble and eyeing the bear with rider, 'It is this way Pobble-san, come I will show you.' Where did he come from anyway? He motions with one hand for Pobble to follow heading towards one of the paths.  Giving a startled cry, Liv is forced to hold on.. or be dumped in the dirt. She gives a cry of exclamation as she starts to  tug on ythe bear's shoulders saying 'No! No! Not the water!'  Pobble is momentarily distracted by the ridden bear and looses track of his reply. Mouth flapping he finally finds some  words, sounding weary and a little agitated. 'Picnic grounds? I parked somewhere near a picnic ground and have been wandering all night. I'm fuckin' tired now. I want to go home.' The arrival of Kaze throws him further off guard and he gawps at the man as if to say 'What are you doing here?' Either way, he begins to walk towards him and his direction.  Yes, the water. The ground practicly shakes as the bear eats up the distance and ... SPLASH! He comes to the surface looking quite pleased with himself.  Falling off the bears back, Liv is soaked easily to the bone. Sputtering and spitting out water, she comes up to the  surface and splashes at the big white bear.  Matt chuckles a bit. 'Water, it's wet.'  Swimming to shore, Liv shakes herself off the best she can, and then moves towards the trails and back into the woods...   Seems she doesn't want to stick around all wet.  Pobble peers at the hoohaffle and shakes his head lightly, forcing himself to move onwards with the aid of his big stick.   The monkey still cowers mostly out of sight in the hood and he comes to a halt next to Kaze, leaning across to whisper. 'Please.. get me out of here.' He seems quite anxious at the situation unfolding about him.  Zoe watches as Pobble seems to go off with.. wait, where did Kaze come from? Talk about people coming out of the woodwork today! Blinking a few times, she turns back in time to see the bear hit the water, and Liv swim to shore and disappear. Giggling finally, she hides the smile, turning to look at Matt for a moment, brow raised in silent question to him before turning back.  Polar-bear lumbers out of the water and shakes off, creating a brief rain storm. You can almost see him laughing. That is under the sandwhich, er monkey catches his eye again.  Matt nods to Zoe, and moves to greet teh bear and his companion. 'Heya. I'm Matt - Zoe says you're a friend of hers.'  Kaze nods to Pobble and leads him up the path to the North and away.  Kaze makes his way north.  Kaze has left.  You make your way north.", "annotations": [{"summary_1": "The game is set in the Mead Forest, in the world of Alti Lake.

{"id": "cnndm_08a4d0036ff55125a429e10d29e44989d239d23d", "src": "Istanbul, Turkey (CNN)The questions Turks asked on Tuesday were tinged with fear. \"What's going on? What happened? Why can't I get into the subway?\" asked an elderly woman in a white headscarf with several shopping bags as she stood outside the barricaded entrance to one of Istanbul's busiest subway stations. She was one of millions of Turks left confused and concerned by the worst power outage to grip the country in more than a decade. Dozens of cities across Turkey lost power for hours on Tuesday. Millions of people were affected, including passengers stranded on paralyzed trains and subways. Municipal workers were forced to evacuate Istanbul's Marmaray Tunnel, where the black-out left commuters trapped deep beneath the rushing waters of the Bosphorus Strait. More than 24 hours later, Turkish officials were still at pains to explain the power outage. The energy minister suggested a possible failure in transmission lines. The prime minister did not rule out the possibility of a terror attack. The mysterious collapse of much of the country's energy grid triggered a burst of wild conspiracy theories across social media. Some Twitter users went so far as to suggest the black-outs were a warm up for elections scheduled to take place in June. There is fertile ground for rumor-mongering in Turkey. Over the last five years, security forces have arrested hundreds of army generals, journalists, prosecutors, civil society activists and police commanders and accused them of being members of assorted plots aimed at toppling the government. The government's increasingly heavy-handed repression of public dissent, combined with overt censorship of the media and the internet, have also contributed to a hyper-polarized and deeply mistrustful political atmosphere. Even Turkey's veteran deputy prime minister, Bulent Arinc, recently observed that opposition supporters now look at him \"with hatred\" rather than the grudging respect he enjoyed when his political party first swept to power in elections in 2002. Meanwhile, mysterious black-outs are a sore spot for some Turks, after a surreal 2014 incident on election night -- allegedly involving a feline saboteur. That is -- a cat that allegedly wandered into a power transformer. That was almost exactly a year ago, a smaller series of power outages affected some polling stations during nationwide municipal elections, prompting unsubstantiated accusations of vote rigging. The ruling Justice and Development Party ended up winning by a comfortable margin, but few Turks were reassured by the energy minister's explanation that the voting day black-outs were caused by a cat getting lost. As electricity was just starting to come back on in Istanbul on Tuesday, a second crisis erupted. Websites linked to an extremist leftist militant group known as the DHKP-C began publishing chilling photos of a masked man holding a pistol to the head of a hostage in front of communist flags. Two gunmen had somehow infiltrated the Palace of Justice, the monolithic court house in the center of Istanbul. There they took hostage Mehmet Selim Kiraz, the prosecutor in charge of one of the most politically sensitive trials in the country. The gunmen demanded the confessions of police officers accused of shooting a tear gas canister at Berkin Elvan, a 15-year-old boy who was critically wounded during anti-government protests that raged across Istanbul in 2013. The boy's death after months in a medically-induced coma triggered a fresh burst of protests and riots against the government. On Tuesday, in the midst of the hostage crisis at the court house, the Turkish government imposed a gag order banning broadcasters from reporting on the Palace of Justice siege. The broadcast ban is a measure that the Turkish government has repeatedly used in recent years to stifle reporting on deadly terrorist attacks. The government also famously shut down Twitter and YouTube in an effort to kill highly embarrassing political scandals involving corruption. Ultimately, Tuesday's court house siege ended in a deadly hail of bullets that left both gunmen dead and the prosecutor mortally wounded. Turkish officials say special forces raided the court house only after the militants began shooting. Online and in the streets, some Turks began linking the massive electricity blackouts to the hostage-taking inside one of Turkey's best-protected buildings, even though there is little to suggest the two incidents are connected. Just hours after the shooting, tensions exploded yet again at the court house. Istanbul's police chief had called for a press conference. As journalists jostled their way through security at the entrance to the largely deserted courthouse, some bystanders began chanting \"government thieves.\" Just hours after a devastating lapse of security at the Palace of Justice, police began detaining the demonstrators hurling abuse at their elected government. The reactions to Tuesday's bewildering series of events revealed several truths about contemporary Turkey. The country is tense and confused after years of back-to-back political crises. Heavy-handed censorship has left the mainstream media widely distrusted and discredited by broad segments of society. And the absence of a common, credible space for sharing information has pushed critics of the government to the fringes of social media. Amid the burst of optimism and civil society activism in the early heady days of the Arab Spring in 2011, Turkey was often cited as a possible democratic model for countries in the Middle East.  Many of those Arab countries have since descended into conflict, repression and instability. In the meantime, Turkey feels increasingly vulnerable to demons of its own making.", "annotations": [{"summary_1": "Dozens of cities across Turkey lost power for hours last Tuesday.

{"id": "cnndm_0c3378f7968d8c3b2309485806a9cc6a0035837d", "src": "Washington (CNN)A year after ISIS became a household name in America, using brutality and savvy propaganda to challenge al Qaeda and its affiliates for jihadist adherents, U.S. prosecutions of would-be recruits have exploded. The flurry of arrests -- at least 25 people have been detained since January -- is a sign that complicated, manpower-intensive investigations begun when ISIS started seizing swaths of territory a year ago are finally being completed. But they also highlight the unique challenges that ISIS poses in comparison with al Qaeda, which has attracted fewer U.S.-based recruits. Like a new rock band storming the music charts, ISIS has benefited from a media environment that amplifies its propaganda, law enforcement officials said. The group quickly reached early recruits through videos that showcased the fear its adherents instilled in nonbelievers. At first, most of the recruits were self-starters -- people radicalized on their own from consuming ISIS propaganda from YouTube videos and other social media. Much of the propaganda comes in the form of slick movie trailer-style videos, some glorifying brutal practices such as the beheading of anyone who ISIS leaders decide doesn't comport with their medieval brand of Islam. But once those initial Western recruits arrived, living in the self-declared ISIS caliphate spanning parts of Syria and Iraq, they started to directly entice friends and other contacts back home to join them. In Minnesota, nine men have been charged as part of an alleged cell of recruits linked to American Abdi Nur, who turned up fighting with ISIS in Syria in 2014 and began to appeal to his friends to come to the Middle East. \"Each one of those folks who makes it over there has the capability to reach out back to their contacts back here,\" a senior U.S. counterterrorism official said. It's a phenomenon observed in Norway and other European nations, where clusters of young people have been lured to ISIS. And the ISIS recruiters have an easier path to drawing supporters than al Qaeda has had. A decade ago, that group's recruits faced formidable obstacles trying to get to training camps deep in hard-to-reach areas of Afghanistan and Pakistan's tribal region. Few Westerners went through the trouble. Minneapolis men allegedly trying to join ISIS highlight role of American recruiter . Today, ISIS occupies much more accessible territory, mostly reachable through Turkey. Istanbul's airport has easy connections to Western Europe and much of the rest of the world. From there, Turkey's modern infrastructure offers quick access to the border regions where smugglers can help jihadis get across to Syria. The informal recruitment networks and ease of travel have presented a difficult puzzle to intelligence and counterterrorism officials, who are used to tracking networks of facilitators and fundraisers that funnel recruits eastward. \"It's harder for us to pick up on,\" the U.S. counterterrorism official said of the peer-to-peer recruitment, which is well below the radar. How ISIS is luring Westerners . Before ISIS, investigators could often focus on radicalizing mosques and clerics to figure out those networks. Al Qaeda recruitment focused on attracting radicals who were motivated to join the fight to protect Islamic holy lands. Much of the recruitment occurred in countries with strong conservative Islamic histories, including Saudi Arabia and Yemen, U.S. officials said. In contrast, ISIS takes a somewhat secular approach, portraying how much better life purportedly is in the caliphate as compared to the corrupt West. And people attracted to ISIS' marketing run the gamut from rich to poor, educated to dropout, male to female, teenaged to middle-aged. There are signs Western recruits have risen to high levels in the ISIS organization, with their influence reflected in the latest propaganda, counterterrorism and intelligence officials said. The English is proper, with fewer grammatical and spelling mistakes. And while the large number of arrests show that law enforcement officials are succeeding in their disruption efforts, it also means that U.S. authorities don't see the lure of ISIS receding any time soon. \"We are opening cases quicker than we are closing them,\" the U.S. counterterrorism official said.

{"id": "cnndm_09baf216db3ca56cffbb3aad0726a3e86fd5ecc1", "src": "Boston (CNN)After weeks of dramatic testimony, jurors are set to begin deliberations Tuesday in the trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who faces life in prison or  the death penalty for working with his brother to explode bombs at the 2013 Boston Marathon. The defense and prosecution made closing arguments in the case on Monday. \"The defendant brought terrorism into the backyards and main streets,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Aloke Chakravarty said. \"The defendant thought that his values were more important than the people around him. He wanted to awake the mujahideen, the holy warriors, so he chose Patriots Day, Marathon Monday,\" a time for families to gather and watch the marathon. Bomb survivors and victims' family members wiped away tears and comforted each other in court. Tsarnaev fidgeted at the defense table as he has done throughout the trial. Bill Richard, father of 8-year-old bomb victim Martin Richard, craned his neck to watch Tsarnaev as the prosecutor spoke. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev \"chose a day when the eyes of the world would be on Boston,\" Chakravarty said. \"He chose a day when there would be civilians on the sidewalks and he targeted those civilians: men, women and children.\" The lawyer waited a beat. \"He wanted to terrorize this country. He wanted to punish America for what it was doing to his people.\" The prosecutor showed a picture of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his brother Tamerlan in the marathon crowd. The day of the bombings, Chakravarty said, \"they felt they were soldiers. They were the mujahideen and they were bringing their battle to Boston.\" Tsarnaev, 21 years old, stands accused of 30 counts, including setting off weapons of mass destruction at a public event as an act of terrorism. Seventeen of those counts carry a sentence of death or life imprisonment. If Tsarnaev is found guilty of at least one of the 17 capital counts, the trial will proceed to a second phase, the so-called penalty phase. That part of the trial will include evidence of aggravating and mitigating factors, and the jury will be asked to weigh elements that make this crime especially heinous against details from Tsarnaev's background and mental health history that would weigh in his favor. Since testimony began on March 4, federal prosecutors have called 92 witnesses, and the defense just four. It seemed a mismatch from the start. \"He was there,\" defense attorney Judy Clarke conceded as the trial opened, but the defense strategy always had been to focus on persuading the jury to spare Tsarnaev's life. The prosecution on Monday played a graphic video of the scene of the bombing that showed a chaotic, bloody scene with injured people everywhere. A child's piercing cries are heard. It's the son of Rebekah Gregory, who lost her leg. Then, another photo is displayed. This time jurors see Tsarnaev standing by a tree behind the family of little Martin Richard. \"These children weren't innocent to him,\" the prosecutor said. \"They were American. He knew what that bag was designed to do.\" Chakravarty quoted Bill Richard, Martin's father, who earlier testified, \"I guess we were just unlucky that day.\" But luck had nothing to do with the Boston bombings, the prosecutor said. \"This was a cold, intentional, terrorist act,\" he said. The brothers' acts that day were intended, he said, \"to make a point. To tell America, 'We won't be terrorized by you anymore. We will terrorize you.' \" The defense has maintained that Tsarnaev, who was 19 and flunking out of college at the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, fell under the sway of his older, more radicalized brother. \"It was Tamerlan,\" defense attorney Clarke repeated during her closing argument Monday. \"In the past few weeks we have come face to face with tragedy, suffering and grief in dimensions none of us could imagine,\" she said. \"We've heard words, we've heard screams and we've heard cries. For this suffering and pain there is no excuse.\" She acknowledged her client participated in a \"senseless act.\" But he was only following his brother, she insisted. \"If not for Tamerlan, it would not have happened,\" Clarke argued. The older brother, a 26-year-old former Golden Gloves boxer, had hoped to wage jihad and his slacker younger brother was just along for the ride, the defense has said. During the 15-minute rebuttal period, prosecutor William Weinreb told jurors not to be distracted by the defense's \"attempt to point the finger at somebody else.\" \"There should be no doubt in your mind that the defendant and his brother are equally guilty,\" he said. They were \"partners in crime.\" Weinreb pointed out that after the bombing Tsarnaev went to the grocery store. \"Tamerlan Tsarnaev didn't turn his brother into a murderer. To shred the bodies of women and children with a homemade type of bomb, you have to be different from other people,\" the prosecutor said. If you are capable of such hate, such callousness that you can murder and maim 20 people and then drive to Whole Foods and buy some milk, can you really blame it on your brother?\" From the start, prosecutors presented a compelling case in which the horrors of April 15 to 19, 2013, were vividly brought to life once again. They began with the stories of bombing survivors and first responders, who described acts of courage and compassion amid madness and chaos. The final moments of the three Boston Marathon spectators who died were recounted by the people who were by their sides. According to testimony, Tamerlan Tsarnaev set off a bomb made from a 6-quart pressure cooker, explosive powder from fireworks, duct tape, nails and BBs on Boylston Street near the finish line. That bomb, which exploded near Marathon Sports, claimed the life of Krystle Campbell, a 29-yeaer-old restaurant manager. Twelve seconds later, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev allegedly detonated a second, similar bomb outside the Forum restaurant, slightly more than a block away. That blast killed the boy, Martin Richard, and Lingzi Lu, 23, a graduate student from China. Chakravarty's voice grew soft Monday as he recalled the victims: . Richard's 69-pound body \"was shattered, broken, eviscerated, burned. There wasn't a part of this boy's body that wasn't destroyed.\" Lu \"received blast injuries all over her body. Her leg was torn open and she bled out.\" Krystle Campbell died in less than a minute from \"massive blast injuries to her lower extremities. Parts of her body were shredded.\" Sean Collier, the MIT campus police officer killed three days after the bombings, \"never had a chance.\" He was shot between the eyes. \"They assassinated him.\" The brothers allegedly killed the 26-year-old officier for his service weapon but couldn't pry it loose from a safety holster. Dun Meng told the jury about his frightening 90 minutes with two carjackers, one who admitted being involved in the marathon bombing. He identified that person as Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Police fired 210 rounds at the brothers when they tracked a GPS device in Meng's stolen Mercedes and cornered them in Watertown, Massachusetts. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev struck Tamerlan, who was wounded, when he charged police in the car. Tamerlan died of his injuries. \"Tamerlan wanted suicide by cop,\" the prosecutor said Monday. \"He was ready for heaven. But the defendant had other plans.\" Dzhokhar ditched the stolen car and sought shelter in a dry-docked boat parked in a trailer in a backyard in Watertown. As he hid, he used a pencil to scrawl what prosecutors called a \"manifesto,\" in which he said he was jealous of his brother for dying as a martyr and reaching paradise. He also lashed out at the United States for policies he said killed Muslims, writing, \"I can't stand to see such evil go unpunished. We Muslims are one body, you hurt one you hurt us all.\" Federal prosecutors also presented evidence gleaned from searches of the brothers' computers, including militant literature written by top al Qaeda leaders. And they traced the purchase of the pressure cookers, ammunition and BBs, which appeared to have been made by Tamerlan.

{"id": "blog_21", "src": "I have been seconded to London for six-months and have now been here about one-month. This is not the first time I have lived in the UK (I lived outside Cambridge for four years in the early 90's) and that certainly has made the transition easier. My familiarity with the grocery stores (I prefer Waitrose), telephone/utility companies and tax issues (one has to pay council tax and don't forget the TV license) meant that within three weeks of my arrival all of the major arrangements needed for day-to-day living had been made.  I am living in a very small, one-bedroom flat (less than 450 sq ft) in South Kensington very close to the V&A. Neighborhoods in London are small so I am  very  close (walking distance) to Knightsbridge and Chelsea and slightly further (1-2 miles) from Notting Hill and Holland Park. When I moved into my 'furnished' flat I had two suit cases of clothes and 3 bags filled with sheets, towels and a few other items. Eight boxes arrived from the US a week later and my move was complete. As I became acquainted with the contents furnished with my flat I realized I would need to 'fill in' if I was going to live there for six months. Some were small (measuring spoons) while others were larger (microwave, lamps and rugs).  Before I go too much further, I should say the obvious. London is expensive - or more accurately, very expensive. If you missed it, it was recently designated as the second most expensive place in the world to live in behind Tokyo. To give you some perspective, NYC was #27 on the list. So, in that background I began the process of buying what I would need to make my flat home for the time I am here.  In the US, I am an avid gardner so one of the first things I wanted was house plants. I heard about  Chelsea Gardner  (125 Sydney Street, Chelsea) and hoped I would be able to buy a few house plants. If you have a garden the Chelsea Gardner is the place to go. They have everything needed for a great garden - a good selection of plants (indoor and out) as well as garden furniture, pottery, gardening books and the all important wellies. If you buy too much to take home with you (don't drive, parking is horrible) they can deliver. The quality is good but don't expect any bargains.  At  Divertimenti  (139/141 Fulham Rd, South Kensington; Ph (0207) 581 8065) I was able to fill in my kitchen needs . This kitchen store has everything any cook would need as well as many things you might only use once.

{"id": "blog_33", "src": "Ok when i was watching harry potter on wed i got an unexpected sms from jing xuan. My first 3 months classmates whose very sporty and tall. She asked us ( my former class T9) whether we could join her and her church group at sentosa for an outing. at first i couldnt decide whether to go as firstly i doubted that i could get up early enough the next day, my movie ended at midnite and i got home around 0040. we were supposed to meet up at 9 the next day at harbour front. Secondly i dun really noe her church group. In the end i just decided to go, it was an oppurtunity for me to catch up a bit with her and get to see her church group  So i woke rather early and hitched a ride on my parents car to reach dhoby ghuat interchange before taking the train to harbour front.There i saw a lot of ppl waiting, after waiting for a while jing xuan came and introduced me to some of her church friends, who incidentally were the pple gathered at the station. I then realised i was the only one besides her who was from T9.   I met a couple of pple who were all in jx's church group, most of them were in jc's with a few adult leaders i think. The group proceeded to sentosa where the station games started . I was in jing xuan's group together with her fellow track mate jieyun, nayun a tall and muscular acjcian basketballer and yong ming also from acjc. They were friendly and sociable and didnt mind my presence as an outsider. The first game played was the treasure hunt, we scoured all over the beach for items. However the coconut we got got eaten be the other pple. The second game was hydration, basically each group had to finish 7 cans of soft drinks. Our group had only 5 pple but we drank really quickly. Lolx after that we were all like so stuffed with gas  Next was a  game where after burying jing xuan in the sand,i and nayun swam across the little strait to an island and had to guess what they were saying, they drew the letters using their ahem bottoms. I didnt realise they were trying to spell my name. -embarrased-  After lunch i met a guy named amoz whose from catholic high, wow he sure can make ppl laugh, his jokes are lame but funny. We played games like dog and bone and beach volleyball. After that, jingxuan suggested to ride the monorail and we agreed to do so. It was a long ride but we entertained ourselves by talking cock among ourselves and doing lame stuff. Amoz was like the entertainer on board.That was the first time in dunno how many years i rode the monorail. We stopped by bk at the ferry terminal for a quick bite.  Later we got back to the beach just in time for the beautiful sunset. It was really nice to see the sun melt over the horizon. We finally left sentosa at around 1930. I got to really thank jing xuan for this oppurtunity to attend to this outing. She said the outing would be fun and it sure is. It sort of gave me an insight what her church group was like.", "annotations": [{"summary_1": "my first 3 months classmate asked us to join her and her church group for an outing.

{"id": "cnndm_060eca2f7301be29235f5aabb8ca6fbb2759df60", "src": "(CNN)Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, was once known as the murder capital of the world. Back in 2010, at the height of cartel violence, the city averaged 8.5 killings per day. But five years later, local officials say the city is much safer, and plans are underway to lure foreign tourists and investors back to Juarez. This month the city launched the tourism campaign \"Juarez is Waiting for You.\" The rebranding effort started quietly a year ago, and on April 10, it was on full display. Mayor Enrique Serrano officially kicked off the campaign, giving what he called an \"unprecedented\" high-profile tour to regional leaders from the United States and Mexico. U.S. Rep. Robert \"Beto\" O'Rourke of Texas was one of those on a leg of the Juarez tour. His congressional district includes El Paso, Texas, which sits directly across the Rio Grande. O'Rourke says there's good reason for locals to be hopeful. \"As a region, El Paso and Juarez represent 20% of all U.S-Mexico trade. The binational ties are strong and have remained strong,\" O'Rourke says. \"Yes, we had a really difficult time for a ... period. Juarez was at one time the deadliest city in the world.\" O'Rourke speaks of a time between 2009 and 2012 when men, women and children were killed indiscriminately. Many were helplessly caught in the cartel violence. Others were victims of the drug turf war. It wasn't that long ago, O'Rourke says, that he thought twice about crossing the bridge into Juarez. \"(Now) I travel to Juarez regularly to have lunch or meet people or just to go. I always feel safe and secure.\" A spokesman for the Chihuahua state attorney general's office told CNN that at one point, there were days when Juarez had more than 20 killings. \"That was normal,\" spokesman Julio Castaneda told CNN. \"It's safer now.\" The numbers from the attorney general's office seem to bear that out. More than 3,000 people were killed in the city just four years ago, but so far this year there have been 89 killings, according to Castaneda -- a dramatic decrease in the violence. \"Undoubtedly, the work we did here in the past year with the police institutions, and specifically the local police, helped. There was a coordinated effort between agencies,\" Castaneda said. \"Without a doubt this work played a part in breaking apart the gangs that were plaguing the city.\" The government cleaned up corruption within the local police force, and fired or arrested a lot of bad cops who were helping the cartels. Another factor that may have helped: The turf war between the Juarez and Sinaloa cartels essentially ended, with the Sinaloa cartel claiming victory in the battle for the trafficking route in Juarez. O'Rourke argues that the El Paso-Juarez border is \"safer than it's ever been.\" He cites the \"30 million lawful crosses from El Paso into Juarez\" last year as a symbolic step. Yet there are those who don't want to celebrate too soon. \"For Juarez to be considered a safe city, there's a long way to go,\" says Sergio Meza, executive director for Plan Estrategico de Juarez, an independent organization that works to improve the city's quality of life. \"Just this past year (in 2014) there were 424 homicides. In 2007, there were 272. Yes, we're not as bad. But we're still very sick,\" Meza told CNN from his office in Juarez. \"In reality, we're progressing from the conditions that were generated by the insecurity. We're still working out the corruption in the city. It's still an issue here.\" With more than 40% of Juarez living below the poverty line, according to Plan Estrategico de Juarez, the future of the city will depend on \"the people's participation in public matters.\" In fact, the organization's slogan is \"Nothing is fixed alone. Participate.\" \"We are looking at a compromised future,\" Meza said. \"We don't talk about that. We don't have the money to generate work here.\" One bright spot: U.S. investment is making a comeback. American companies Delphi, Honeywell, Flextronics and Lear are among those that ramped up hiring and investment in Juarez over the last year. That hiring would have been hard to imagine four years ago. But with the average salary at $20 per week for local workers in the maquiladores, or factories, along the U.S.-Mexico border in Juarez, Meza says more needs to be done. The scars from the recent past remain. Several buildings downtown are shuttered and marred by graffiti. Americans who, before the violence, came to Juarez for bargain shopping have not returned in the numbers seen before the spike in violence. But in a sign of progress, the U.S. State Department amended its travel warning for the city. While it still urges visitors to exercise appropriate caution, it's no longer telling people not to come. Longtime residents of Juarez and neighboring El Paso may be reluctant to say the wounds of the violent past have altogether healed. In the last year, however, they have definitely noticed that \"life is back.\" \"I measure it by the everyday coming and going of people,\" Gustavo Reveles, 39, told CNN. \"For someone who grew up on the border and for someone who spent half of his life crossing the border on a weekly basis, it's encouraging to be crossing back to Juarez without that sort of hesitation or worry that something might happen.\" Reveles lived in Juarez until he was 15 and now lives in El Paso. He says the threat of violence is \"still a little bit concerning,\" though that hasn't stopped him in recent weeks from going to Juarez to meet friends for dinner and drinks. \"Things have changed,\" he said. \"To go through what Juarez went through, you see life there again. You see a semblance of what was there before. To really recover and heal wounds, there's a long way to go, but the process has started and that's a step in the right direction.\" CNNMoney's Octavio Blanco contributed to this report.", "annotations": [{"summary_1": "In 2010, Juarez averaged 8.5 killings per day.

Sure there were some good finds, we even bought a coffee mug and another glass. Then left. As soon as we got into the car I washed everyone's hands with a wipe.&nbsp; Then we took a look at the goodwill store. Mainly to see if any of our stuff we brought was put out. And it was :) So we come home only to feed the baby and grab a quick sandwich for ourselves and then we were off again. We did have certain items on our list to get. So we looked for our want items and put off our needed items until we were finished. First store Walmart #1&nbsp;we look for the doll we look at the exercaucer.

Nope.. no luck there either. We pick up our needed items and cash out. Baby is hungry. My aunt lives just around the corner. Lets go there. It's now 6:00pm. I feed the baby and get a tour of her new house. It's VERY nice!&nbsp; My mom calls and says 'hey have you guys eaten dinner yet?' no I reply.

{"id": "blog_35", "src": "(For those of you who didn't know, I wrote an article against gay marriage and homosexuality in general for my school's newspaper. It was published in April, obviously during the school year. I am no longer on the newspaper staff, thank God. I'm just glad that I got the article out there for people to read and think about. A lot of the stuff under this is stuff I wanted to write in that article but knew the editor would never let it be published.)  I have been thinking about this for a while now, and it is time for me to go off. I have a friend (and yes, for future reference, we are actually very good friends, although it is beyond me how that came about because we are so different in what we believe) who is 'homosexual.' We argue about this issue frequently. He sometimes says that 'God is an invention of people in power to keep the people they wanted to control in check.' He tells me this almost as often as he tells me that the only reason I think 'homosexuality' is wrong is because I have been told that by my parents who were told that by their parents who were told that by  their  parents, and so on and so forth until you get to some silly, old-fashioned, close-minded priest* somewhere who had somehow gotten the idea in his head that oh my goodness, 'HOMOSEXUALITY' IS A SIN. Well, it is, if you take the Bible at face value, which you should. (Read Genesis 2:24 to see what God says a family should consist of and Romans 1:26-27 to see where God says that 'homosexuality' is not natural.) But my friend doesn't like hearing that someone out there isn't afraid to disagree with him.   The reason I put the word 'homosexual' in quotes is because personally, I don't believe there is such a thing as 'homosexuality.' There are no 'homosexuals.' This is because 'homosexuality' is NOT something you are 'born with' and it's not something you can't change. Sexual orientation isn't determined by your genes or an unbalance of chemicals or   The whole idea of more than one sexual orientation in the first place is something that was created by man to justify their actions. Different people have different stumbling blocks - some lie to get out of whatever trouble they've gotten into, some are kleptomaniacs, some succumb to the temptation to look at or watch pornography, and some gravitate towards members of their own gender on a romantic level and say 'it's natural.'  A 'homosexual' is (and this will sound harsh) just another word for someone who is living completely in sin... much like a drug addict or even a murderer. Now don't get me wrong, I am in NO WAY calling people living 'homosexual' lifestyles druggies or murderers. There are definitely some relatively 'good' people who call themselves 'homosexuals', I can attest to that. As many times as my friend who is 'homosexual' threatens to run me or other people who occasionally irritate him over in the parking lot with his car, I know he won't. But murderers and druggies can change the way they are living their lives in the same way that anyone else can stop giving into the sinful nature of their humanity. I'm no better than anyone who says they are 'homosexual'. The only difference is that I have given my life to Jesus Christ, and through him I am rescued from any sinful desires I may have... and believe me, just because I'm a Christian doesn't mean it's any easier to resist them. But at least I can know for sure that God will provide a way to escape the temptations so that I can stand up under them. (1 Cor. 10:13) People who don't have that relationship don't have the ability to stop living in sin and are going to try their very best to convince everyone that their favorite kind of sin is a perfectly normal thing.   'Homosexual' activists constantly argue that 'if God says we should love one another, then why don't you? God loves me the way I am, he made me this way!' First of all, yes. God loves you. God loves you so much that he gave his only Son to die for you. Don't ask me why, we're really special to him for some reason that I will never fully understand. But think of it this way. Your parents love you, right? But if they find out you're shooting heroin in your closet, they aren't going to be too happy. If they're good parents, they're going to try and get you into rehab and to get you to kick the habit. It's sort of like that with God. He loves you more than anything, and yeah, he will take you as you are if you're willing to come to him and worship him, but he doesn't want you to keep living in sin. Jesus didn't die on the cross so you can say 'wheeee, God loves me, now I'm going to do whatever I want because it's the way I am.' Yeah, it's the way you are, but you DON'T HAVE TO STAY THAT WAY, and if you don't want to change then you haven't really understood what it means to be a Christian. Jesus died on the cross so that you can have a way to escape your sin nature. He doesn't WANT you to keep living in sin. And he clearly defines what sin is in the Bible, so you can't get away with anything. He's going to forgive you if you ask him to, but if you just go and do whatever you want because you know you'll be forgiven, you are abusing his amazing grace. If you truly and honestly love the Lord, you will strive to obey him and please him. People who are not truly walking with the Lord should not be able to get away with saying 'God loves me the way I am.' God loves you the way he created you, and he created you to worship and love him. If you're not doing that, you are instead dishonoring God's intentions for your body. What 'homosexuals' do is not what God intended for them, therefore the argument that 'God loves them the way they are' does not apply.   Because some 'homosexuals' are Christians who have fallen for the worldly lie that says they are 'born that way,' the rest of the 'homosexual' community believes oh, well THOSE must be the real Christians, because they love us for who we are. It's time for us to stand up for ourselves. The truth is so rarely heard anymore and frankly, I'm tired of being the only one defending what the  real  real Christians believe to my 'homosexual' friend. We got in an argument during my science class one day and we were practically screaming at each other by the end of it, and all the other Christians in the room that I knew were listening were just sitting idly by, watching and listening. Maybe they thought I could handle it, but still, some support would have been nice. Or maybe they were afraid he was going to cuss them out, which could very well have happened. It happened to me practically every day. The world has been trying to get Christians to shut up for forever. There is always someone out there who is going to throw everything they've got at you. Get over it. It comes with the territory (John 15:17-19). There are worse things than being ridiculed for believing in God. Like, all your friends going to hell, for example. Keep that in mind.   *I'm not Catholic, but some of my ancestors could very well have been. My dad has researched our family tree for as long as I can remember, it's sort of a hobby. We're not Mormon either and he's not looking for names to baptize into the church. I think we had some Mormon ancestors though.

{"id": "cnndm_029f5f6775ecd8b5fad0dc0e55ab4a9754fcad8f", "src": "(CNN)Ever had a headache so big, you felt like drilling a hole in your head to let the pain out? In Neolithic times trepanation -- or drilling a hole into the skull -- was thought to be a cure for everything from epilepsy to migraines. It could even have been a form of emergency surgery for battle wounds. But while there is still conjecture about the real reasons behind the mysterious procedure, what is known is that the implement often used to carry out the primitive surgery was made from one of the sharpest substances found in nature -- obsidian. Obsidian -- a type of volcanic glass -- can produce cutting edges many times finer than even the best steel scalpels. At 30 angstroms -- a unit of measurement equal to one hundred millionth of a centimeter -- an obsidian scalpel can rival diamond in the fineness of its edge. When you consider that most household razor blades are 300-600 angstroms, obsidian can still cut it with the sharpest materials nano-technology can produce. Even today, a small number of surgeons are using an ancient technology to carry out fine incisions that they say heal with minimal scarring. Dr. Lee Green, professor and chair of the Department of Family Medicine at the University of Alberta, says he routinely uses obsidian blades. \"The biggest advantage with obsidian is that it is the sharpest edge there is, it causes very little trauma to tissue, it heals faster and more importantly it heals with less scarring,\" he said. \"It makes for the best cosmetic outcome.\" He explained that steel scalpels at a microscopic level have a rough cutting edge that tears into tissue, a function of the crystals that make up the metal. Obsidian, meanwhile, cleaves into a fine and continuous edge when properly cut. Dr. Green said he once helped documentary makers produce a program on surgical technology in ancient Egyptian, setting up a blind test on the cutting power of obsidian. Using cultured-skin burn dressing, a substance composed of skin cells, he made an incision with a modern scalpel and a parallel incision with an obsidian scalpel. The host of the program was then invited to look at the cuts under a video microscope and tell the difference. \"It wasn't hard to tell the difference at all -- as soon as he turned around everyone in the studio was like 'Ohhh',\" Dr. Green said. \"Under the microscope you could see the obsidian scalpel had divided individual cells in half, and next to it the steel scalpel incision looked like it had been made by a chainsaw.\" Modern obsidian scalpels look nothing like the decorative flint-knapped knives of Neolithic man, often resembling their modern counterparts in everything except for the blade edge, but Dr. Green said they are a very different animal. \"The feel is very different because obsidian has no 'bite,'\" he said. \"If you look under the microscope at a steel scalpel edge it looks almost like a saw, it has teeth, whereas obsidian is smooth even microscopically. \"It's a very different feel to work with and you have to practice before you start using it in surgery. \"You also have to be careful not to nick yourself with it because you don't even feel it!\" And Dr. Green believes incisions made with these blades heal faster. He said a colleague who needed a mole removed agreed to undergo an experiment where half the procedure was carried out with an obsidian scalpel and the other half was removed with steel. \"What's really fun is seeing it heal,\" he said. \"Four weeks later the difference was quite remarkable -- there was very much a difference in scarring.\" In Germany, the manufacturer Fine Science Tools produces obsidian scalpels which can be used in situations where the patient may have an allergy to steel or metal. \"For studies where trace metals from ordinary scalpel blades cannot be tolerated, these very special obsidian scalpels may provide the answer,\" the company says. At \u20ac99 per scalpel ($107.40), they represent a considerable saving on their diamond cousins which the company prices at \u20ac712.50 ($772.60). But there has been little academic research into the efficacy of obsidian blades compared to steel scalpels, and they do have disadvantages: Obsidian scalpels are not Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved, and they are extremely brittle and prone to breaking if lateral forces are applied -- meaning they are unlikely to ever be in widespread use. Dr. Green, whose scalpels were manufactured for him by an expert flint-knapper and archaeologist Errett Callahan, concedes the Stone Age scalpels are not for everyone. \"If it was let loose on the market there'd be far too many injuries from it,\" he said. \"It's very fragile and it's very easy to break pieces off.\"", "annotations": [{"summary_1": "In Neolithic times, trepanation was thought to be a cure for everything from epilepsy to migraines.

{"id": "blog_13", "src": "Chicago Tribune Jeff Zeleny  Jul 13, 2004    The moment the Democratic presidential ticket arrived here on a recent afternoon, Sens. John Kerry and John Edwards embraced their wives, waved to the cameras and walked down the steps of their campaign plane to greet a line of dignitaries waiting on the tarmac.      Elizabeth Edwards went her own way.   For days, she had been shaking hands with strangers. It was now time to set politics aside and find the little girl and boy with pink and blue knapsacks, and through the crowd rushed her children, Emma Claire, 6, and Jack, 4, whom she took by the hand and led away from the commotion.   Democrats believe Elizabeth Edwards' poise and wit will validate the vice presidential candidate and serve as a selling point for swing voters. But Edwards--a former bankruptcy lawyer, teacher and one of her husband's best political guides--bristles when comparisons are drawn to other political wives, insisting she is simply trying to get accustomed to having someone carry her suitcase.   'I'm 55 years old,' she said in an interview aboard their campaign plane as it flew from West Virginia to New Mexico. 'I lived most of my life out of the public spotlight where it never crossed my mind to model myself after somebody.'   The Democratic running mate's lively, down-to-earth wife may offer a complement to Teresa Heinz Kerry, who last week gently referred to Edwards as 'Mother Earth.' As Teresa Kerry introduced her at a Cleveland rally last week, she noted that Edwards, like her husband and John Kerry, was a lawyer. But she added, 'She can talk people-talk too.'   Elizabeth Edwards was an accomplished lawyer, but she ended her practice after their teenage son, Wade, died in a 1996 car accident.      Tragic turning point     Neither Edwards nor her husband dwell on the loss or are eager to have it become a campaign story, but it is only through that tragedy that their family portrait can be fully explained. At age 48 and 50, she had two more children, saying it was the only way to bring joy back into their home for her and her husband and their daughter, Cate, 22.   As the Democratic team introduced itself last week, the young Edwards children became an instant attraction. To audiences around the country, Kerry repeatedly told stories about the families' dynamic tableau -- 'Jack is the new campaign manager. He's running the show!' -- that stood in sharp contrast to the Republican ticket.   But Edwards said she is determined to guard her children from being used for political advantage through television commercials or too many appearances. Even though John Kerry's references to her young son were touching and genuine, she said, the attention also could be wearisome.   'Yes, I think there are things that are too much,' Edwards said. 'I kept wanting to say, `I appreciate how much you are attracted to Jack, but Emma Claire is actually standing right here.' Like a normal parent, you have to give them the same attention.'   On the campaign trail, no one avoids explaining that Edwards had children at a late age and looks older than her 51-year-old husband. In fact, last week, her husband told a crowd of senior citizens in Florida that her AARP card arrived just before Jack was born. She tells voters her husband is the same person she married him 26 years ago and adds, 'To my chagrin, he looks exactly the same.'   She does not, however, disclose details about her pregnancies to audiences.   'There are a few things that I don't talk about. I would say that I took hormone shots, but I won't talk about fertility or things like that. It's not ladylike!' Edwards said with a laugh. 'I don't want a blow-by-blow of your operation or your things, and I'm not giving you one of mine.'   Edwards said that like many Americans she has tried the South Beach diet. While too much attention may be placed on image, she conceded that images are important in a televised political world.   'People make judgments based on appearances, but we spend too much time on it,' she said. 'To me, the issue has to do with my own personal comfort about whether I'm being self-conscious or whether I can let that part go and not worry about it.'   As she stood on stages from Ohio to Florida to New York, she received booming applause from Democrats, who said they found her refreshing, enlightening and inspiring.      Powerful persona     'There's a powerful maternal aspect about her,' said Karen Ballard, a nurse in Manhattan who saw Edwards at a fundraising breakfast last week at Pier 94. 'She has a real warm personality. She doesn't seemed rushed.'   During the Democratic primary, Edwards often traveled by herself on campaign trips and waited for her own luggage at baggage claim. On one flight from South Carolina to Washington, a prominent commentator dressed down a flight attendant for not delivering a cup of coffee. Edwards witnessed the scene and offered a kind word of assurance to the shaken young woman.   Earlier in the primary campaign, Edwards candidly voiced her frustration to strategists that her husband's candidacy seemed to be stuck. One confrontation, according to a former adviser, helped spark new ads emphasizing his optimism and character.   'Elizabeth is very blunt. She does not censor herself,' one former aide said. 'John really relies on her to know the right thing to do. She's not very political, but she always advises him on what is the right thing to do.'      Life-changing moment     As the Edwards family waited to hear who Kerry would select as a running mate, she said she was not as anxious about the choice as the timing.   Then, she said, 'What happens of course, is the ball drops, then all of a sudden your world blows up.'   With her young children, Edwards said she isn't sure how the fall campaign schedule will unfold. She plans to play an active part, but she said she gave the Kerry campaign one piece of guidance: 'Don't feel like you need to have me do something to keep me happy. I only want to do things that make a difference and translate into votes.'   A hint of her role emerged last week when she reminded an audience in St. Petersburg, Fla., that she was born in Florida and that her parents and a string of aunts and uncles still live there. It is, after all, one of the biggest battleground states and the place that decided the 2000 election.   While she prefers speaking to small groups, Edwards proved in Raleigh last weekend that she could master a far larger crowd. As thousands of admirers, stretching a block in either direction, shouted that they couldn't hear, she cleared her throat and fixed the problem.   'I'm an old high school cheerleader,' she said. 'I'm going to see if I can make those fellas in the back hear.'   And she did.", "annotations": [{"summary_1": "Elizabeth Edwards is a former bankruptcy lawyer, teacher and one of her husband's best political guides.

A search for logic or reason amidst the ranting will do you no good, friend, as I can assure you, here and now, that you will find very little if any in what is written here. I do, however, promise to provide a nightmarish wonderland acid mind rape ride \u2013 whisking you away to enlightenment as yet unknown by most.   First up is Gary Busey.    Bio, crime, sentence of: Gary Busey     Bio  Born June 29, 1944 (A product of his father maddening booze escapades and subsequent trips to his daughter\u2019s room for \u201cdaddy-touchy-time\u201d) in the bustling metropolis of Goose Creek Texas, it was clear from the onset that Gary Busey was destined for stardom. Busey would begin developing his trademark disheveled appearance and splotchy hectic complexion early on by chugging moonshine with daddy at the tender age of 9 \u2018neath a big ol\u2019 Texas sky bristling with heat.    Presumably, it is at this age that he is lost in a drunken sheep-fucking haze that would never completely subside. Rather than working to his detriment, it allowed Busey to see his way clear to breaking into show-biz with The Rubber Band, an obscure rock band in search of\u2026 you guessed it, booze and loose women. After meeting The Doors and the Byrds and much sampling of their sweet sweet \u201cschwag-ass\u201d marijuana, The Rubber Band records a predictably sub-par and all together painful concept album titled, \u201cSet a while, Pedophile\u201d with CBS/Epic records.   His foot now in the door, Busey \u201crocked\u201d his way into several embarrassing television appearances in the early 80\u2019s. His pungent body order and riotous imbibing (coupled with the inevitable drunken belligerence) gave cause for many to hire him in the hopes that he would \u201cjust go away\u201d. It was then assumed that Busey was merely a privileged studio hobo who wandered from set to set. Leave it to the likes of Busey to fall short of those expectations.  Fueled by gin and a right shitty personality, Busey shambled his way into several film roles including 'Carny' (1980) (Busey as, Vera Stemple - an abusive alcoholic bearded lady), 'Barbarosa' (1982), 'Silver Bullet' (1985) and 'D.C. Cab' (1983). Still unable to get rid of Busey in the Italian sense, films makers created roles that fit Busey\u2019s abusive and unstable personality. Busey was set lose on the street of Los Angles with an 8-ball of coke, 2 hookers, a 1.75 of rum, and a videographor  24 hours before 'Lethal Weapon' was filmed in 1987. The footage gleaned from the ordeal was spliced into the film \u2013 Busey never once looked at a script.   Busey's film career continued to flourish in the 90's as he starred in such movies as 'Predator 2: Gay and Unashamed' (1990), 'Point Break' (1991), 'Hider in House' (1991), 'Under Siege' (1992), 'The Firm' (1993), 'Warriors' and 'Drop Zone' (both 1994) and, the film that made Christ wet, Sidney J. Furie's 'The Rage' (1997). Busey also lends his gutter-trashed voice to the best-selling video game,  Grand Theft Auto: Vice City.  Television, film, and super rock stardom were not to be Busey\u2019s only claims to fame. His personal life was to be more than outstanding. After nearly dying of head injuries in a booze fueled \u201cspiritual quest\u201d motorcycle accident in December 1988, Busey feel madly in love and married Julie Amber-Misty Deadham \u2013 a 14-year old prostitute turned card shark. Apparently having too much love to give, Busey married and divorced an impressive 21 times. In 1971, one of his \u201cjunky bitch\u201d wives gave birth at her prom in a bathroom stall. Unable to \u201ctake out the garbage\u201d, she named it \u201cJake\u201d and another generation of Busey was set to take the stage. Arrested and released on bail after a fight with his 12th wife, Tina \u201cSomethingorother\u201d, Busey would learn to focus on the one true love of his life\u2026 whisky. He divorced Tina in June of 1998. Ass play with Jack La Lane had not been ruled out as a mitigating factor in the divorce at that time.    Crime  Birth. That's right kids - I hate him because he was born. If you\u2019re offended by my synopsis then you too, deserve to die. Honestly, if you love Gary Busey and you know it, kill yourself.  ........I\u2019m not kidding.   Gary Busey's entire life is a \u201cFrench Mistake\u201d. From now on I'll equate the lowest form of things in terms of their relation to Gary Busey and Sponge Bob Square Pants. Spongebob - a fictional character, a non-person - has  a better career, sex life, and coke dealer than Gary Busey witness the approach of the apocalypse......   http://www.comedycentral.com/tv_shows/imwithbusey/   How the fuck did that come to pass?! HOW!??!?  This pretty much speaks for itself. If you need more evidence than this, please don\u2019t hesitate to let me know\u2026 I\u2019ll personally come right on over and disembowel your parents. This is clearly a precursor to Gary Coleman\u2019s 'triumphant' return to television and I, for one, will not let such an injustice stand.   Sentence  I'm keeping my fingers crossed for heroin and STD's but that may be a vain hope. To be honest, I smell suicide. The man can\u2019t even bottom feed. He\u2019s being followed around by an obsessive college drop out magician\u2026. His end is nigh.    That said, thank God that my job was made easy this time. Burn in hell, Gary Busey.

{"id": "cnndm_0c4f14a0d887abcf5c19e2fc7712b28a4d442ebf", "src": "(CNN)Most airline pilots have an above average ability to compartmentalize personal problems. The cockpit is our \"safe\" place. The flight deck is a structured world of black and white. Checklists. Procedures. Standardization. Stress from the job is an accepted part of our career. However, sometimes during the course of an airline pilot's career, or anyone's career for that matter, stress issues may manifest as depression. Depression is treatable. And for airline pilots, it is no longer debilitating to our livelihood. The Federal Aviation Administration now approves certain prescribed medication, allowing us to continue flying until depression is no longer a factor. As the world learns more about Andreas Lubitz, the co-pilot on Germanwings Flight 9525, it is readily apparent that this young man had psychiatric issues far beyond clinical depression. He reportedly was administered a series of injections to mitigate his problems, an absolute reflection on the serious nature of his illness. But Lubitz's illness didn't just appear out of thin air.  Its effects had to be apparent to others. Lubitz's girlfriend made her concerns public knowledge -- unfortunately after events took their course. Considering the hoops Lubitz had to jump through to have established himself as a Germanwings co-pilot, it's curious to me how the red flags of his illness were missed. To what hoops am I referring? First, let's start with his passion for gliders. Glider flying is one of the purest forms of aviation. Although it is mostly an individualistic endeavor, the sport involves teamwork. Interaction among fellow enthusiasts is paramount to both enjoyment and safety. I'm a glider pilot. Participation among the members of my club uncovers the personalities and idiosyncrasies of each pilot. Behaviors not quite conducive to the activity are readily apparent. Second, Lubitz had to compete successfully in a selection process just to have the opportunity to train through Lufthansa's flight program, a requirement of Germanwings employment. The selection process is most likely highly competitive, requiring above-average aptitude. Is the selection process flawed to the extent that a serious mental disorder would go unnoticed? Regardless, the process had to be a stressful experience. Opinion: Germanwings and the stigma of mental illness . Once accepted into the flight program, a rigorous training period began. For primary training, Lufthansa utilizes an ab initio (from the beginning) program based at a facility the airline owns in Goodyear, Arizona, near Phoenix. The training is geared toward a multi-crew pilot license, or MPL, recognized by the International Civil Aviation Organization. The purpose of an MPL is to funnel airline pilot candidates having little or no flight time into the right seat as first officers. Countries that don't have the luxury of selecting from a large pool of experienced pilots use this license. Airline pilots in the United States are not licensed in this manner, requiring as much as 1,500 hours to qualify as a co-pilot. This is a fairly recent change in FAA regulations, initiated as a result of the 2009 Colgan Airlines crash in Buffalo, New York. Lubitz had barely over 600 hours of flight time when he committed his act of horror. As a 21-year-old flight instructor, I had that much flight time; it hardly qualified as a lot of experience. As with all of the MPL programs, the training involves an intense period of airline-specific instruction. And to add insult to injury, candidates are not paid during the training until such time as they pass a final check ride. Regardless, the cost is borne by the student to the tune of about $76,000. Using both actual flight experience in a single-engine airplane and simulator time, the student receives about 250 hours of training. It is a period of almost constant supervision. Aside from observing and checking performance criteria, wouldn't at least one instructor have noticed behavioral issues in such an intense environment? And wouldn't a fellow trainee have noticed also? According to reports, Lubitz took a leave from his training -- a very untypical behavior. Was that not in and of itself a red flag?  Wouldn't a manager in Lufthansa's flight department consider it prudent to reconsider a candidate with an indication of potential issues? After all, the selection process was most likely highly competitive, with other qualified candidates readily available. Once the primary training in Arizona was complete, Lubitz would have returned to Germany and completed more specific schooling on the Airbus A320 he was about to fly. Again, no one observed issues. But even more curious, according to reports, Lubitz disclosed a diagnosis of previous depression to Lufthansa. Over the course of a career, an airline pilot spends thousands of hours sharing the confined space of the cockpit with colleagues. Even if we have never flown with a particular individual, experience allows us the intuition to know when something isn't quite right. That determination can be made through performance observation of typical routines, or perhaps through a simple conversation. In that regard, I find it difficult to believe that none of Lubitz's colleagues made a less than positive assessment at some point in time. As supplemental background, Germanwings had been established as the low-cost, alter ego carrier of Lufthansa. Depending upon a pilot's monthly flight time, salary for pilots can be as much as 20% lower than the mainline carrier. In addition, more days on duty were part of a Germanwings crew member's schedule. Apparently as late as March 20, Lufthansa pilots had been on strike, one of the main disputes being an early retirement option and less desirable working conditions for new hires. Perhaps enough of a disparity existed for Germanwings pilots such that medical leave benefits would not have covered Lubitz's absence. Regardless, all of these factors combined to add a perfect storm of stress to one sick 27-year-old man. The world knows the end result. It just seems to me that this was an accident waiting to happen. Could it have been prevented? Well, this is the primary purpose of accident investigation: Never allow the same tragedy to occur again.", "annotations": [{"summary_1": "Andreas Lubitz had psychiatric issues beyond clinical depression, says David Soucie.

The reading list for St. John's is available on the Internet. Here it is: http://www.sjcsf.edu/academic/curri8.htm Not to be too blunt about it, but the Western Heritage is relevant to us, and the Eastern heritage is not.   Should there be non-Western Civilization entries on the list? The answer is no. There is hardly enough room as it is on the bookshelf of a student, or in the brain of a student, to give the works of our own civilization and culture an honest examination. Understanding the work of strangers is a leisure; understanding the work of one's own life and legacy is a duty. We live in an age where our next generation has been raised in appalling ignorance of our civilization, and whether they will be able to pass it intact their children is in doubt. Now is not the time to neglect our forefathers further. Not to be too blunt about it, but the Western Heritage is relevant to us, and the Eastern heritage is not.   Take a look at today's newspaper. You might see a debate about the justice of the war in the Middle East. The notion of the 'Just War' that frames the debate was invented by St. Thomas Aquinas, based on Aristotelian thought. Familiarity with these root ideas deepens an otherwise shallow understanding of the debate. In contrast, Sun Tzu's theory of warfare did not affect Aquinas or Machiavelli or Clausewitz, and does not influence the theory or practice of warfare in the modern West. Reading the Bhagavad Gita or the Book of Five Rings, the Shahname or the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, will add nothing to the student's understanding of the debate. Even in China itself, the main tension is between the ideals of Marx and Adam Smith, two Western men. The student riot and massacre at Tiananmen Square were not caused by a dispute over the ideas of Mencius or Xunzi And so likewise for all the great issues of our day. Our debates are always framed in terms of individual rights, the sacredness of human life, the duties a patriot owes his city. These ideas are from the Enlightenment, the Middle Ages, or from Ancient Rome. The notions unique to the East, Dharma and Karma, the Four Noble Truths, the Middle Path or the Way of Heaven, deepen no understanding of a Western discussion.    I'd say that the situation he describes so well IS the problem. Perhaps if the West had spent less time shoving its own ideas and values on us unwashed pagans, the world wouldn't be in this mess. Maybe it's time to seriously see what other cultures have to offer the overall human discourse.

Or maybe she just didn't want to talk to me. Whatever. Anyways, I'm planning on hanging out with Emily tomorrow, but I probably won't be able to spend more than a few hours with her, because I have to complete my MasterDrive on-street session tomorrow at 1:00. And Emily has volleyball later that night. Oh well. I'm kinda looking foreward to the on-street session of MasterDrive. I'm glad all of their cars are automatics, because I don't think my instructor would be too happy with my shifting abilities. But I think I'm a lot better at shifting than I was a month ago, so yay! At least on-street will be more exciting than the classroom. I did the classroom last week, and it was SO boring! I sat next to this guy, Hugh. He was a pretty funny kid hehe. We both arrived early, so we were just sitting there waiting for class to start. Then he just randomly turned to me and said 'Hi! What's your name?' 'I'm Katherine.' 'Katherine. Hi Katherine!' 'Hi...' Then there was an akward silence while I waited for him to give me his name. But he didn't. So I asked him. 'What's your name?' 'My name's Hugh! I'm Hugh.' '...Hi Hugh.' 'Hi Katherine! Nice to meet you!' '...Um...yeah...' 'I went to etiquette school, and they taught us that when you're alone with someone, you should try to make conversation.' Haha, I honestly could not hold back my laughter when he said that. I just burst out laughing. I felt sooo bad, but Hugh was cool about it. He was actually a really nice guy, and not nearly as weird as his first impression seemed, heheh. Not to mention he had gorgeous eyes... *sigh* I don't think I would have made it through that class without him.    On Saturday, Julianne and I volunteered at the zoo for a walkathon. We were assigned to the T-Shirt booth, and I think we were a pretty good team. I took the people's tickets, signed them, and put them in the box, while Julianne gave people a T-Shirt in their desired size. We were out in the sun for the whole morning, so I tried to even out my god awful tan line, but alas - no success! But it was seriously really hot out there; Julianne and I were reminded of that horrible bike ride at the beginning of June. We were finally allowed to leave the T-Shirt table at lunch time, so Julianne, my mom and I headed off to the bathrooms, and on the way we discovered that volunteers were allowed free massages by a pro massage therapist! It didn't feel as nice as I expected. He worked on my ankles, and that really hurt - then he massaged my legs, and that tickles soooo badly! Then he finally got to my back, and that was actually pretty relaxing, for the most part. Every once in a while he hit a ticklish spot on me, but nothing like when he massaged my legs. When he finished, my ankles hurt so bad... but I was able to walk it off. We all walked up to the pavillion, where pizza was promised for lunch, but it hadn't arrived yet, so Julianne and I set off to feed the giraffes. We walked up this huuuge hill, only to find that they moved the giraffes! They were at the very bottom of the hill! So, we walked back to the pavillion, ate lunch, and left. Afterwards, we went and saw The Village. It wasn't nearly as good as I expected. Ah well, we ran into Kathleen and Jennee on our way out, so we had a nice chat with them.

{"id": "cnndm_0b8afba5b0e6d9ac633a58ef4b6cb830e3fcd85c", "src": "(CNN)The idea of sustainable development is that raw capitalism is far too powerful for its own good. Global capitalism is a juggernaut, with the world economy now doubling in size every generation.  Yet on a finite Earth, with a billion new people being added every 15 years, that juggernaut is now laying siege to the physical bases of life and the social support systems that make life pleasant and decent.  Sustainable development offers a path out of this growing crisis. The reality is that raw capitalism is the economics of greed.  Unleash greed, the theory goes, and type-A personalities around the world will spend inordinate energy to organize businesses, invent new products, and thereby raise well-being. And in some sense, there's a lot to say for this theory.  After all, the world economy has expanded at least 100-fold since modern industrial capitalism first found its footing in Britain around 1800, and for most of the world, living standards have risen markedly along the way. Yet history has also taught us that the \"Invisible Hand\" of the free market is a little less miraculous than it looks. Instead, untrammeled greed also leads to massive fraud, mega-tax evasion, pervasive bribery, modern slavery, rising inequalities, and environmental destruction. Perhaps most important, it feeds moral blindness.  Too many of the super-rich, whether they are calling for drilling in the Arctic for oil or encouraging the cutting down of the rainforests for tropical hardwoods, simply deny the irreparable damage they are causing to the planet. It\u00b9s no surprise that the Wall Street Journal runs anti-environmental editorials on what feels like a daily basis.  The environment is a nuisance and a hindrance to greed.  And greed rules the moral order at the top of raw capitalism. Novelists, ethicists, activists, unionists, preachers, teachers, and others have long known these facts, but the juggernaut has proved hard to tame. Unleash greed as the supreme economic good, and it is greed that we get as the ultimate moral arbiter. Sustainable development is a doctrine that says: Let us once again place the economy on a true moral foundation and we'll keep greed within bounds, ensuring the economic growth is combined with social fairness and environmental sustainability. The idea of sustainable development is that an economy must satisfy all three principles: economic growth, social fairness and environmental sustainability.  Yes, there can and should be economic growth, especially for today's developing countries.  Human ingenuity and markets can indeed lead us to higher living standards and longer lives for all parts of the world, rich and poor alike.  But these gains should be widely shared and should never be based on the exploitation of those at the bottom of society.  Social inclusion has been widely shown to improve societal progress broadly for all.  And equally important, those gains should be based on true value added, not on the destruction of natural capital, whether through deforestation, climate change, or pollution of air, land, and water. Thus, sustainable development calls for a holistic approach that combines economic, social, and environmental objectives.  This balanced approach is much harder to achieve than the raw capitalism that places the economy above society and the physical Earth.  Yet it recognizes that we are doomed to conflict and even collapse if we fail to promote social equality and environmental sustainability. Just look at the recent news.  Last year was the Earth's hottest year on record, and another year of mega-storms, droughts, floods, and heat waves.  Major parts of the world, from Pakistan and Iran to California and Brazil, are experiencing mega-droughts, and the prospect of catastrophic water scarcity in the future unless something changes.  And even as the world economy grows and millions escape extreme poverty, our societies become more unequal, less trusting, and corrupt.  All over the world, there is unrest on the streets even as our generation is the beneficiary of unprecedented technological knowhow and material progress. In my new book, The Age of Sustainable Development, I\u00b9ve not only analyzed the trends of growing inequality and rising environmental destruction, but have also shown how the concepts of sustainable development can be used to chart a way out of our growing crisis.  It turns out that with goodwill, cooperation, greed kept in check, and technological savvy, we can build a modern global economy that is productive, inclusive, and environmentally sustainable all at the same time. The ongoing revolution of information and communications technology (ICT) is an incredibly powerful enabler of new sustainable technologies.  And doubters about the feasibility of sustainable development should have a look at Scandinavia \u00ac Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, as they are the closest on the planet to achieving this Trifecta of prosperity, fairness, and sustainability. Consider the challenge of climate change, for example.  Big Oil and Wall Street executives too often simply deny the science.  Yet a science-based sustainable development perspective shows that not only is human-induced climate change very real and very dangerous, but that it is also solvable at very low cost by switching over the next 30 years to electric vehicles, heat pumps, well-insulated buildings, smart ICT-enabled grid, wind and solar energy, and other low-carbon and energy efficient technologies. If the world takes the time to do its homework and plan for the future, the world can bring the climate crisis under control and still enjoy a growing supply of quality energy services. And, more generally, although the U.S. political system still feeds untrammeled greed by enabling super-rich campaign donors and lobbyists to buy the political class, the American people and much of the rest of the world are coming to recognize the urgency of sustainable development.

The kickoff to the new season leads the list of six things to watch in the week ahead. 1. \"Orphan Black,\" 9 p.m. ET, Saturday, April 18, BBC America . The cloning cult sci-fi series remains one of the most critically acclaimed shows on TV, thanks in large part to the performance of Tatiana Maslany, who has taken on at least six roles on the show so far, including a newly introduced transgender clone. Maslany told reporters this week that we can expect even more impressive scenes with multiple clones. \"We like to push the boundaries of what we're able to do and the limits of those clone scenes,\" she said. \"So, yes, you'll definitely see more complex clone work this season and that's just because we're getting more comfortable with the technology and we're excited by getting to sort of further complicate things.\" And the introduction of a group of male clones will certainly increase the suspense. \"There definitely is a shift towards the Castor clones that we get to explore them a little bit more,\" she said. The fans of the show, dubbed the \"Clone Club\" have a lot to look forward to when the show premieres on Saturday the 18th, and Maslany is blown away by the response to the series so far. \"We've always been really humbled and really inspired by our fans and by their dedication to the show and their knowledge of the show, and  just how it changes their own lives. It's incredible.\" 2. \"Turn: Washington's Spies,\" 9 p.m. ET, Monday, AMC . The series about spies in the early days of the Revolutionary War returns with a new subtitle, \"Washington's Spies,\" and a new Monday night time slot. Series star Jamie Bell told CNN what we can expect in the second season. \"This year we have a lot more battles; we have the journey of [George] Washington and we're getting under his skin a little bit as well. We also introduce new characters like Benedict Arnold, a very infamous character in American history.\" Bell hopes the series might bring more recognition to the Culper spy ring and everything it did. \"I think there should be a monument to all of the Culper ring somewhere. I was amazed that there is nothing [in Washington] about these people who did something extraordinary.\" 3. \"Game of Thrones,\" 9 p.m. ET, Sunday, HBO .

{"id": "cnndm_0a57c604f972b4b190cf02819ef1b50d0886d88a", "src": "(CNN)More than 22 months ago, the body of Odin Lloyd was found in an industrial park in North Attleboro, Massachusetts. Lloyd had been shot seven times near a pile of construction waste. The semipro football player for the Boston Bandits was 27. Days after he was found dead, then-NFL star Aaron Hernandez was arrested and charged with murder. Testimony in the case against Hernandez began in January. On Wednesday, a Fall River, Massachusetts, jury -- after deliberating 35 hours over the course of seven days -- found the former New England patriots tight end guilty of first-degree murder, which carries a penalty of life without parole,  as well as unlawful possession of a firearm and unlawful possession of ammunition. Hernandez also faces murder charges in a 2012 double homicide. He has pleaded not guilty. Just two years ago, he was one of the NFL's most promising tight ends, inking a $40-million contract extension with the New England Patriots. Friends and fans alike wondered: How could the star player who had more than 900 receiving yards in 2011 now be on trial for murder? Long before Hernandez made national headlines, he was a standout athlete in Bristol, Connecticut, who came from a family described as a local sports dynasty. \"I don't think there was another family that was more familiar in Bristol,\" Bob Montgomery, who covers high school sports for the Bristol Press, told CNN. The young Hernandez was the \"golden boy,\" playing football, basketball and running track, following in the footsteps of his uncle, older brother and father -- all well-known athletes in the community. Hernandez's father constantly pushed his son, requiring him to practice for hours before he could go out with friends. \"I saw a closeness with them that I'd never seen before,\" Montgomery said of the relationship between Hernandez and his father. But his father, the man who kept the 16-year-old anchored, died from complications after a routine surgery. Hernandez left high school halfway through his senior year in January 2007 to join the University of Florida Gators, and trouble seemed to follow. In just his first semester, a police report says, Hernandez got into a fight at an off-campus restaurant, sucker-punching the manager and rupturing his eardrum. The following fall, there was a shooting near a local club. Police reports linked Hernandez and several other University of Florida football players to an argument in the parking lot. Hernandez was one of more than 20 people interviewed by police, and he was the only one who did not make a statement after invoking his right to counsel. At the time, Hernandez's mother told the Orlando Sentinel newspaper, \"I know he was at the club, but he never saw any shooting.\" The case remains open, and no one has been charged. Hernandez was also suspended at least once for marijuana, an issue that would follow him as he entered the draft his junior year. Trying to put the alleged drug use behind him, Hernandez wrote a letter to the Patriots director of personnel. \"If you draft me as a member of the New England Patriots, I will willfully submit to a biweekly drug test throughout my rookie season. ... In addition, I will tie any guaranteed portion of my 2010 compensation to these drug tests and reimburse the team a pro-rata amount for any failed drug test,\" he wrote, according to the Boston Globe. Before the draft, Hernandez was expected to be a first- or second-round pick. He was passed over until the fourth round, when the Patriots selected him. By the end of his second season, he was a bona fide star, landing the $40 million contract extension. Less than a year after signing the deal, however, the Patriots dropped him on the day he was charged with Lloyd's murder. When Odin Lloyd pulled up in a black Chevrolet suburban, Boston Bandits coach Mike Branch thought something was out of place. Lloyd didn't own a car. Aaron Hernandez case: Who's who? Branch had his suspicions, but he couldn't get answers. Lloyd was too busy telling his friends about the good time he had at the club the previous night. \"He said he was at the club with Mr. Hernandez, and that they were partying and he had a good time, and that Mr. Hernandez spent a good amount of money,\" Branch recalled. Lloyd said Hernandez spent about $10,000 that night. Lloyd's friends say he wasn't a big partier. He was more passionate about football and family. Remembering Odin Lloyd . Lloyd was dating Shaneah Jenkins, the link between the young man who dreamed of the NFL and the all-American who made it. Jenkins is the younger sister of Shayanna, who's engaged to Hernandez and is the mother of his little girl. On June 16, 2013, Lloyd was riding with friends in the black Suburban, which police later learned was rented by Hernandez. Daryl Hodge was with Lloyd when he said Lloyd got a text from Hernandez, asking to hang out later that night. As they parted ways, Lloyd told Hodge he'd see him later. The next day, Lloyd's body was found. Prosecutors say Lloyd was last seen with Hernandez and Hernandez's two associates, Carlos Ortiz and Ernest Wallace, around 2:30 a.m. in a rented silver Nissan Altima. Surveillance video from security cameras at an industrial park showed an Altima heading toward a secluded area at 3:22 a.m. At the same time, chilling text messages from Lloyd's phone were sent to his sister telling her he was with \"Nfl,\" adding, \"just so u know.\" Between 3:23 and 3:27 a.m., workers nearby reported hearing gunshots. At 3:29, a camera showed an Altima pulling into Hernandez's driveway, about a half a mile from the death scene. Three people got out of the car, and Lloyd was not one of them. Nine days later, Hernandez was arrested and charged with first-degree murder and other weapons-related charges. He pleaded not guilty. In April 2014, Ortiz and Wallace were also charged in Lloyd's slaying. They, too, pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors say the three men were to be tried in a joint venture, a legal term that means it's not necessary to prove who pulled the trigger as long as there is evidence that each defendant actively participated in Lloyd's murder. As the trial for the death of Lloyd neared, lawyers began arguing about evidence, including cell phones and text messages. Some rulings were victories for the defense. The jury wouldn't see the text Lloyd sent to his sister, telling her he was with \"Nfl.\" The judge ruled it hearsay and said the state hadn't proven Lloyd believed his life was in danger. Jurors also didn't hear anything about what happened in Boston on July 16, 2012 -- the night two men were murdered outside a club where Hernandez had been. The judge agreed with defense lawyers that it's far too prejudicial and irrelevant to Lloyd's murder. Investigators allege Hernandez shot and killed Daniel Abreu and Safiro Furtado because one of the men bumped into him on a nightclub dance floor and spilled his drink. District Attorney Patrick Haggan described the scene in a Massachusetts courtroom in May, saying Hernandez became \"angered and increasingly agitated, particularly after Mr. Abreu smiled and did not apologize.\" Prosecutors: Bump, spilled drink led to double homicide . Hernandez's friend tried to calm him down, and the pair walked outside and eventually entered a second club across the street, the prosecutor said. Court documents identify that friend as Alexander Bradley, who would go on to accuse Hernandez of shooting him in the eye in an incident that would take place seven months later. After leaving the second nightclub, Hernandez and the friend returned to their SUV and pulled over on a nearby street where Hernandez removed a revolver from the engine block, Haggan said. Hernandez began trailing Abreu, Furtado and three of their friends in his SUV, authorities said. He then pulled up to the victims' car at a red light and leaned out the driver's side window with a loaded revolver, Haggan told the court. Hernandez allegedly said, \"Yo, what's up now,\" followed by a racial slur, and fired at least five rounds from a .38-caliber revolver, Haggan said. Abreu, the driver, was shot several times and fatally hit in the chest. Furtado was sitting in the front passenger seat and suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including one to the head, Haggan said. Hernandez was charged in the double homicide in May, and he pleaded not guilty. Investigators found evidence they believe links him to the 2012 slayings while investigating the death of Lloyd.

{"id": "blog_24", "src": "It was my last day of work and my former boss made a move on me...  Finally on Thursday we found someone to replace me and Friday was her first day of work. I only had practically half of day to get her into the workload which is nothing but still there were things that needed to be done.   My boss invited me several times before to have lunch with him to celebrate Admins. week, but for one reason or the other this could not be done, but now that my last day of work was ending, lunch had to be done no matter what. I really don't feel comfortable eating lunch with my bosses, I mean, what kind of conversation am I going to have? Right? Well, it looked like I had no other choice but to accept the invitation and I was waiting for an excuse to appear so  I wouldn't go alone.   The new 'girl' didn't bring any lunch for her self and well it seemed kind of unfair and not polite to not invite her out for lunch on her first day of work, besides, she's her new Admin. right? So I told my boss that maybe I should take her out for lunch (I was expecting my boss to ask me to take her along to my fare well lunch but it never happened). Basically my boss sent her to the nearest fast food restaurant so him and I could get along with his plans of having lunch with his Admin. Yikes!  Lunch I guess it was ok, at least he told me some weird stories about how his friends were robbed in Mexico while they were on vacations and that he would never think of coming here by himself alone. And that's where the personal questions began and it wasn't pretty. What kind of boss will ask his Admin. if she's engaged or if she's on a relationship and what of things does she like do to when she's not working? (That sounded more like a date...yuk) So I answered properly without giving him any thoughts that I am interested in his conversation (in the mean time I could not stop looking at my watch, I was waiting for 1:30 to come soon so I could kick him back to the border so I could go back to work). To make a long story short, he suggested we should have lunch together more often because I was an interesting woman and very fun and comfortable to be with, on which I repleid with a HELL NO! (on my forehead) and a no thanks I have work on my mouth.  All of this means that if there was a chance that if I didn't like the job I will start on Monday I would call my boss and ask him if I could come back; with these intentions the man showed me on my last day lunch, that chance is nule.   That really feels baaad; no boss has ever told me that before, I'm still a baby, I could be his daughter, hell! The man is 51 years of age and has a son of 23.   Well now I know why he was insisting soo much on going to lunch just the two of us...  In your dreams old man!  two hours before 5 I had a call from the delivery company. Woo hoo! They would bring my King Bed set at 5 so I had to go home...My problem is solved, they brought me my brand new king size bed, I already slept on it and feels like I'm sleeping under clouds. Ah! This is how heaven must feel like.  Now there's another problem, the bed is too tall and my TV stand is too short, so now I have to go look for a new TV stand because we can't watch TV anymore, the only thing we can see is half of the screen with 2 pairs of feet blocking what is left to see. That sucks!   But hey! Who needs TV with a brand new King Size Bed right?", "annotations": [{"summary_1": "My boss asked me to have lunch with him on my last day of work.

{"id": "cnndm_03e71bbf2d299d2204c90cf823180eb3398895c4", "src": "Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN)More than 4,600 people dead. More than 9,000 injured. Eight million affected across Nepal. One million children urgently in need of help. Those are the startling numbers that indicate the scale of the devastation from the huge earthquake that struck the Himalayan nation on Saturday. And some of the grim figures are likely to get even worse as hopes of rescuing any more survivors diminish every hour. Heartbreaking scenes of suffering and loss are playing out across this shell-shocked nation as it reels from its deadliest natural disaster in more than 80 years. As the country coped with the fallout of the quake, another natural disaster struck Tuesday afternoon in a popular trekking area north of Kathmandu, and up to 200 people were feared missing as a result of a landslide, a trekking association official said. It happened around 4 p.m. in Langtang National Park, said Ramesh Dhamala, president of the Trekking Agents of Nepal. Laxmi Dhakal, spokesman for Nepal's Home Ministry, said  he was aware of reports about the landslide but wasn't immediately able to confirm details. Quake relief efforts continued Tuesday, but officials warned that they were hampered by problems of getting aid into the country and then delivering it to some of the remote communities in desperate need. In Kathmandu, a capital city of shattered temples and toppled houses, some people paid their last respects to loved ones taken by the quake. By the Bagmati River, which winds through the city, more than a dozen funeral pyres burned Monday. As workers stoked the flames for the Hindu cremation ceremonies, some mourners shaved their heads in a traditional show of mourning from children who lose their parents. Alongside their father, two teenage brothers from the Gurung family, Ishan and Iman, said goodbye to their mother, Ishara. \"We never imagined this would happen to us. This much pain,\" said Ishan, the elder of the two. Elsewhere in the city, many shaken residents are sleeping in the open. Some have lost their homes, others are afraid to stay in buildings that may be vulnerable to aftershocks. Large encampments of tents have sprung up in open areas, including a wide space belonging to the military in the center of the city that is typically used for parades. One of the grand gates to the field is now just a pile of rubble. Kisnor Raj Giri, a 22-year-old man from Kathmandu who lost members of his extended family in the quake, said he was too scared to return home. He is camping out at the military grounds with thousands of others even though frequent rain has made the nights an ordeal. \"Many people are crying, sharing their hardships,\" he told CNN on Monday evening. The elements showed no mercy to the homeless masses on Tuesday as thunderstorms rumbled over Kathmandu. More bad weather is forecast for the region in the coming days. But in one piece of good news, Turkish and Chinese rescue crews helped pull free a 21-year-old man trapped under rubble near a city bus park in a 13-hour rescue operation. Houses and families ripped apart by earthquake . The death toll has now climbed above 4,600 in Nepal, officials said Tuesday evening, as rescue and relief efforts continue. Nepal army Lt. Col. A. J. Thapa told CNN's Sumnima Udas that the first 72 hours after the earthquake is the time when the most lives can be saved. \"This is not the time to rest and lament,\" he said. \"This is the time to go out and save lives.\" Thapa said an entire military post was lost during an avalanche. \"Remember we are not an outside force that has been parachuted into an area to help,\" he said. \"We are victim ourselves. ... Despite the fact that soldiers have their families and houses are down, we are trying to build morale, maintain morale and help themselves.\" Thapa said it was fortunate that the quake struck during daylight on a weekend. \"Children were not trapped in big schools somewhere and lot of people were outside because it was daytime,\" he said. Dhakal, the Home Ministry spokesman, put the death toll at 4,620, while Nepal's National Emergency Coordination Center said the number of dead was 4,727. Both sources gave the number of people injured as 9,239. Another 72 people died in India, while China reported 25 deaths. Most of the casualty numbers in Nepal are believed to have come mainly from Kathmandu and the surrounding area. They are expected to climb as information emerges from remote areas. \"We have incomplete information, but we apprehend the death toll will go up,\" Nepalese Information Minister Minendra Rijal told CNN earlier on Tuesday. \"We cannot say by how much exactly.\" The news agency Reuters cited Prime Minister Sushil Koirala as saying that the toll could reach 10,000 and that the country was \"on a war footing\" in its rescue and relief work. In a live, televised address to the nation, the Prime Minister said the country had been stunned by the disaster and announced three days of national mourning, starting Tuesday. The government's first priority is to continue search and rescue operations and relief efforts, he said, as he thanked all those involved. Historic and religious monuments destroyed by the earthquake will be reconstructed in time, he added. At least 90% of 96,000 Nepali army troops have been deployed in relief and rescue operations, according to Nepal army spokesman Jagadish Chandra Pokharel. More than 15 countries and agencies have already promised help, Koirala said, as he appealed for other nations also to come to Nepal's aid. Even as international aid pours into the country, overwhelmed hospitals are lacking vital medical supplies, people remain buried in the wreckage of buildings and rescuers are struggling to reach hard-hit rural areas near the quake's epicenter. \"The biggest problem is reaching these villages,\" Matt Darvas, an emergency communications officer for the humanitarian group World Vision, told CNN from Gorkha district, northwest of Kathmandu. Nepal struggles to cope with international aid . Nepali Home Ministry Joint Secretary Sagar Mani Parajuli, who is coordinating relief efforts, said government efforts to get aid to remote areas had been hampered by rugged terrain and poor weather, which limits the use of helicopters. \"The helicopters are small. They don't fly in windy and cloudy conditions. Given Nepal's geographical terrain, we cannot use surface transport much but are using it,\" he said. \"We need 150,000 tents and tarpaulins, but we don't have enough of them.\" Jamie McGoldrick, the U.N. resident coordinator for Nepal, told a news conference Tuesday that bringing in relief materials has been difficult because Kathmandu's international airport, which has just one runway and space for only a limited number of aircraft to park, is log jammed. The United Nations is aware of the request for tents, he said, but is working to procure high quality ones to withstand the expected monsoon rains. Of the 8 million people affected by the quake across 39 districts of Nepal, some 1.4 million need food aid, McGoldrick added. Nepal's population is about 31 million. At an event in Paris, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed his condolences to the people of Nepal and called the humanitarian needs \"huge and urgent.\" \"The United Nations is supporting international operations for search and rescue and strengthening relief efforts,\" he said. \"I count on the generosity of the international community in Nepal's hour of need and the longer term rebuilding efforts that will be needed.\" A CNN team that joined a Nepalese military helicopter flight to Dhulikhel, a rural area east of Kathmandu, saw extensive damage in the Kathmandu Valley from the air, including many landslides. On landing, the team went to a hospital where all the injured from six surrounding districts are being brought. More than 1,000 people are currently in the hospital -- three times its usual capacity -- so some of the injured are being left out in the streets. Social media posts from Nepal . Darvas of World Vision said he had been told of frightening levels of damage in villages in the region surrounding Gorkha district, which is near the earthquake's epicenter. They included one where 35 out of 45 homes were destroyed and another where 70% of the houses had collapsed, trapping and crushing the people inside, most of them children and the elderly. Even though aid groups and Nepalese officials are aware of critical situations in areas spread across Nepal's mountainous terrain, they face daunting challenges getting help to them. \"Some of those villages -- several years ago, before there was vehicle transport -- used to take seven days to reach. Roads are shut now to some of those villages, so we can only imagine how long it will take to get there,\" Darvas said Monday. He said injured people who had been airlifted from some remote areas were often suffering from crush injuries, lacerations and dislocations. Looking for missing loved ones in Nepal? CNN iReport wants to help . UNICEF, the U.N. children's agency, said Sunday that nearly 1 million Nepalese children urgently need assistance. Aid groups and at least 16 nations rushed aid and workers to Nepal, with more on the way. High-altitude rescue efforts have also been undertaken on the difficult terrain of Mount Everest, where the earthquake released deadly avalanches. Four U.S. citizens are among those who died on Everest, according to officials and relatives. Damage to climbing infrastructure on the mountain, not to mention the overall situation in Nepal, means the climbing season is over for the year, climber Jim Davidson told CNN from the Everest base camp, where he was evacuated after spending two days on the mountain.

{"id": "blog_6", "src": "Rehearsing for my scene work as the duchess has vacillated a LOT.  Luckily, the immediate instructor agrees with my interpretation.  I think it should be smooth sailing from here on out.  Though last Wednesday I had to grapple with SK and her unique view\u2026 as it was her opinion that my exuding \u201csexuality\u201d is my weakness and that I should work on that for performance on stage.  She wanted me to VAMP up the duchess. She suggested that my partner and I roll around on top of each other on a desk, initiate a strip tease... OH PLEASE.  If I wanted to put on a sexual performance, you should offer to pay me like others would.  I have no interest in putting on a sexual performance on a stage.   Things are back on track, and I get to perform a sort of tongue-tied love as opposed to the stripper whore vamp. Yay. And I am paying for this.  Counting the days\u2026  (something borrowed:) The Duchess comes across to the audience as the epitome of stoicism and strength of soul and character. At the beginning of the play, she is portrayed as a a woman of great integrity and honor, such that Antonio speaks of 'her days are practiced in such noble virtue that sure her nights, nay more her very sleeps are more in heaven than other lady's shrifts'. Indeed, we see her as a noble woman of much childlike innocence and naivety. Even her secret marriage to Antonio is not seen as something of lust and sexual desire, but of a woman's need for companionship and love 'tis not a figure cut in alabaster to kneel at my husband's tomb' , something she obviously cannot derive from her villainous brothers. Even at this point, she comes across as a strong character of intense emotion and longing for affection and love that she must resort to a secret marriage. In contrast, her marriage to Antonio seems cleaner than the Cardinal's adulterous relationship with Julia, his mistress. That the Duchess solemnizes their vows shows that she does have moral standards to uphold. Even her 'feigned pilgrimage' to Ancona was something that she and her family did as a real pilgrimage to pay their respect to our Lady of Loretto.  The childlike innocence of the Duchess is seen from the way that she tells Antonio that 'time will easily scatter the tempest' when Antonio brings up the threat of her ARAGONIAN BROTHERS. Yet, it is because of them that she is made to endure 'the worst torture, pain and fear'. One certainly pities her and feels that she should not be made to suffer so much for following her heart. Indeed, Ferdinand's obsession to 'purge infected blood' seems less a move to right a wrong than out of jealousy 'my imagination carries me to see her in the shameful act of sin'. The Duchess in nobly enduring all his cruel torments becomes a 'reverend monument whose ruins are even pitied'. Yet to a certain extent, while we pity the Duchess, one cannot deny that one feels a great admiration for her strength of character. She accepts suffering as her 'fate' and is 'acquainted with sad misery as the tanned slave is with his oar'. Even Bosola is able to realize the dignity in which she bears herself up to the suffering that her brothers make her endure 'as majesty gives to adversity; you may discern the shape of loveliness more perfectly in her tears than in her smiles'. One admires her for being so ready to accept her fate, the suffering she endures a mere consequence of her loving Antonio and marrying him. It is also through her suffering that she derives a new found wisdom 'your kiss is colder than i have seen a holy anchorite give to a dead man's skull'. Indeed, she realises the extent of her brother's tyranny and knows that she an Antonio must part. Their last moments together are certainly touching, and one truly pities her for being denied of true love. To lose the love of her life drains her very soul, and she is left empty and without meaning in life 'my laurel is all withered'. The Duchess accepts her death with humility, 'heaven's gates are not so highly arched as prince's palaces; they that enter there must go on their knees'. Yet to the end, she is dignified 'I am the Duchess of Malfi still'. Indeed, her 'violent death' seems more of a journey to liberation rather than an end in itself. Throughout the play, the Duchess is portrayed as the victim of entrapment, Ferdinand the predator that toys with his prey, the Duchess before killing her. (see THEME OF ENTRAPMENT).  The Duchess is hence a character to be admired and respected. That she is a historical figure shows that Webster was indeed perceptive in the plight of the Duchess at such a time when her behavior to marry Antonio outside the social status of her family would have been dealt with death, no question to the reasoning behind it. Webster's play hence is a statement against this convention, and the Duchess comes across as a real person of human emotion that each and every individual can relate to.", "annotations": [{"summary_1": "The Duchess comes across to the audience as the epitome of stoicism and strength of soul and character.

{"id": "cnndm_00a51d5454f2ef7dbf4c53471223a27fb9c20681", "src": "(CNN)Marco Rubio is all in.  The Republican senator from Florida has announced that he is seeking the Republican presidential nomination, running on an optimistic message that he embodies the promise of the American Dream. With his youthful energy and Hispanic roots, it's tempting to see Rubio as the new blood that the GOP needs in order to compete against Hillary Clinton in 2016.  Yet Rubio has been his own worst enemy on what could have been his two signature issues: immigration reform and Cuba relations.  He holds little appeal to Latino voters.  And unless he can offer new ideas, his climb to the Republican nomination will be steep. Back in 2013, Rubio was a member of the Senate \"Gang of 8\" that crafted a bipartisan proposal for comprehensive reform, including a path to citizenship for the nation's estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants.  He later distanced himself from the bill after it ran into resistance from House Republicans, and now says he favors a piecemeal approach, starting with securing the border. His retreat on immigration means that Rubio has missed an opportunity to set himself apart from most of the presumptive Republican presidential candidates.  That's a shame, for this issue was supposed to be his calling card to Latino voters. Instead, Rubio has embraced a typical conservative approach to immigration.   He believes that President Obama's Deferred Action program, offering deportation relief to young immigrants, should be ended.  He has stated that the President's executive action on immigration, on hold pending a circuit court review, sets a \"horrifying precedent.\" Meanwhile, both the Deferred Action program and President Obama's executive action on immigration are overwhelmingly favored by Hispanics.  No wonder the research firm Latino Decisions reports that, \"We find no evidence that Rubio's candidacy will draw significant Latino support for his candidacy or for his party more generally.\"  So, if Rubio is counting on his ethnicity and personal history as the son of immigrants to win over fellow Hispanics, he is mistaken. At a private breakfast Monday for supporters, Rubio described running against \"one candidate in the race who's from yesterday, and one who wants to take us back to yesterday.\"  But when it comes to Cuba policy, Rubio himself seems firmly stuck in the past.  Over the weekend, he called the recent thaw in relations between the two countries ridiculous. He has warned that Cuba is taking advantage of the United States.  Here, he is an increasingly lonely voice.  Most Americans support better relations with Cuba, as do a majority of Cuban-Americans.  By clinging to the notion that isolating Cuba is better than engaging with the communist country, Rubio has marginalized himself on an issue where he could have provided insight and leadership. Immigration and Cuba policy aside, Rubio's political philosophy will be a tough sell to Hispanics.  He is a fierce opponent of \"Obamacare\" and wants the law repealed.  However, the Affordable Care Act has led to a 12.3% drop in the Hispanic uninsured rate, making Latinos the demographic with the largest gain in insurance, thanks to the law.  (In fact, Rubio signed his own family up for \"Obamacare\" on the Washington exchange, taking advantage of a generous federal subsidy offered to lawmakers.) Rubio favors smaller government, while Latinos are more likely than the general public to say they favor a bigger government that provides more services over a small government that provides less.  And though Rubio doubts that climate change is caused by humans, The New York Times has noted that Latinos view global warming as a problem and favor government action on the issue. Sure, Rubio is young and charismatic.  But his work on the failed immigration bill notwithstanding, Rubio has a significant lack of accomplishments to show for his five years in the senate.  In February, he was reported as topping the list of absentee lawmakers by the website Politico. Another Rubio weakness is his lack of bold policy proposals.  Consider that his fellow contender for the GOP presidential nomination, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, has been willing to present new ideas to the Republican base, such as reforming the criminal justice system and legalizing medical marijuana.  Or that another GOP candidate for president, Sen. Ted Cruz  of Texas is entirely comfortable with his image as a conservative firebrand.  By comparison, Rubio seems cautious and ill-suited to the task of rousing Republican voters. With his early leap into the 2016 race, Marco Rubio is positioning himself as the next generation of GOP leadership.  Unfortunately, a fresh face on stale ideas is not a winning combination -- not for Rubio, and not for Latino voters.", "annotations": [{"summary_1": "Ruben Navarrette: Marco Rubio's youth and Hispanic roots make him a potential candidate.

{"id": "cnndm_012819ffa2547138101055add33deebe7beaa3d4", "src": "(CNN)Mullah Mohammed Omar is \"still the leader\" of the Taliban's self-declared Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. That appears to be the primary message of a biography, just published by the Taliban, of the reclusive militant who is credited with founding the group in the early 1990s. The Taliban's \"Cultural Commission\" released the 11-page document in several different translations on the movement's website, ostensibly to commemorate the 19th anniversary of an April 4, 1996, meeting in Afghanistan's Kandahar province when an assembly of Afghans swore allegiance to Omar. Several Afghan observers say the biography is aimed at dispelling rumors of Omar's demise. \"There have been a lot of rumors lately about him. Some people are saying that he is not alive,\" said Sayyed Muhammad Akbar Agha, a former Taliban insider who has written an autobiography about his days with the movement. \"I think the Taliban thought it was an important time to release his biography to give assurances that he is alive and present,\" Agha told CNN in a telephone interview. Bergen: Why U.S. must stay in Afghanistan past 2016 . The biography also appears to be an attempt to remind the world of the Afghan's jihadi leadership credentials, at a time when ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has declared himself \"caliph\" of the world's Muslims. \"The Taliban has a huge leadership problem at a critical political moment,\" said Graeme Smith, a Kabul-based analyst for the International Crisis Group. \"Another caliph has announced himself to the world, and the Taliban has been silent. And that is getting noticed by militants across South Asia.\" Omar was famously camera-shy during the Taliban's six-year rule over most of Afghanistan. To this day, there are only a handful of photographs of the one-eyed leader. \"He never was actively involved in any of these propaganda campaigns. No publicity. No interviews. He never used the Internet,\" said Rahimullah Yusufzai, a Pakistani journalist and expert on Afghanistan who once interviewed Osama bin Laden. Omar then all but disappeared after a U.S.-led bombing campaign routed the Taliban from Kabul in 2001. Washington has offered a $10 million reward for his capture. The Taliban have released written statements purportedly made by the leader-in-hiding. But years without any video or audio recordings of the fugitive have led to growing speculation that Omar may have died. The biography challenges rumors of Omar's death by offering a description of his daily work schedule, which begins with prayers, study of the Quran, and then delivering \"orders in a specific way to his Jihadi commanders.\" The publication also seeks to fill in some of the gaps about the militant's early years, including the detail that his \"preferred weapon of choice\" was the RPG-7, a rocket-propelled grenade. According to the biography, Omar was born in 1960 in a village called Chah-i-Himmat in Afghanistan's Kandahar province. His father, a \"well-known and respected erudite and social figure,\" died only five years later, apparently of natural causes. Omar studied at a religious school, or madrassa, run by his uncle. The rise of the Communist Party in Afghanistan, and the subsequent 1979 Soviet invasion, interrupted the young man's studies and propelled him into the arms of the armed Afghan opposition known as the mujahedeen. For the next decade, Omar commanded rebel groups \"against the invading Russians and their internal communist puppets,\" according to the biography. Along the way, he was wounded a number of times and was blinded in his right eye. In one battle, the biography claims, Omar and a fighter named Mullah Biradar Akhund destroyed four Soviet tanks, even though they were armed with only four RPG rounds. The Taliban biography makes no mention of the fact that the U.S., allied with Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, helped arm and bankroll the mujahedeen until the Soviet army withdrew in defeat in 1989. Afghan historians have documented the rapid rise of the Taliban in the chaotic years after the communist government in Kabul collapsed in 1992. The movement of warriors who identified themselves as religious scholars emerged to bring order to a country being ripped apart by rival mujahedeen warlords who battled one another for power. The Taliban biography says that Omar and his compatriots \"launched their struggle and fight against corruption and anarchy\" after an initial meeting in Kandahar in June 1994. Two years later, the Taliban captured Kabul and began imposing its austere interpretation of Islamic law on the rest of the country. While the document denounces the Taliban's post-9/11 overthrow at the hands of a U.S.-backed coalition of rival Afghan fighters, it makes no mention of the Taliban's alliance with bin Laden and al Qaeda. During a decade in exile, the Saudi-born bin Laden continued to release periodic video and audio statements until he was killed by U.S. raid on his hideout in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad in 2011. Though Taliban militants have continued to battle the U.S.-backed government across Afghanistan, Omar has not been seen or heard from in years. The movement claims he continues to oversee a Taliban leadership council, judiciary and nine executive commissions, as well as military commanders who operate in all 34 provinces of Afghanistan.

{"id": "cnndm_040ce133116f80d53a2a6333bf81fe07556ab93b", "src": "(CNN)By now, you probably have a position regarding the controversy over Indiana's religious freedom law. You applaud the growing chorus of companies blasting the law as an invitation for businesses to discriminate against gays and lesbians, using religion as a cover. Or, like Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, you are surprised at the backlash and maintain that it is basically a copy of a law that is already in the books at the federal level and 19 other states. The issue drives a wedge because, well, the debate over religious freedom and gay rights is always heated, but also because the interpretations and motives behind the law can be questioned. Whichever side you're on, here are five things you might not have considered when thinking about this controversy. These points might not change your mind, but offer context to better understand the uproar. As the author of the 1993 federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), Sen. Chuck Schumer is one who can offer clarity over the controversy surrounding Indiana's version of the law. Schumer mocks Indiana's contention that the state law is simply a mirror of the 22-year-old federal law. \"That may be true only if you're using a Funhouse mirror,\" Schumer wrote on his Facebook page. The federal law was intended to protect individual's religious freedom from government intervention, he said. The Indiana law justifies discrimination in the name of religious freedom, he contends. Also, the law was envisioned to protect the religious freedoms of individuals, while the Indiana law also protects private companies, Schumer said. So, how can the law's supporters claim it is basically a copy of the federal law? If you look at the purpose of the law, the language in the federal and Indiana religious freedom laws are indeed  nearly indistinguishable. In short --  the government cannot interfere with a person's religious practices unless there is a compelling government interest to do so. The uproar is over that fact that the Indiana law expands the reach of the religious protections to include private companies and cases where the government is not involved. Other states previously passed their own version of the religious freedom law -- Indiana became the 20th. But other state laws mirror the federal law much more closely than the Indiana law does. The key difference in the Indiana law is that it expands the instances where someone can use religious freedom as a defense. This is how it could make a difference: . In 2006, Vanessa Willock contacted a photographer about shooting her commitment ceremony with her partner. This was in New Mexico, a state with a religious freedom law at the time of the dispute. The company, Elane Photography, refused the job because of the co-owner's religious beliefs. Willock sued Elane Photography for discrimination, and the company defended itself by citing the law. The photography studio lost the case because the court ruled that it could not use the religious freedom law because the dispute was between two private parties and not a government entity. What would happen if that case happened today in Indiana, with the new, expanded religious freedom law? For sure, the case would have proceeded to trial, said Tim Holbrook, a law professor at Emory University. The photography studio would have had the chance to make its argument in court that it denied the service because of religious reasons. Would the outcome have been the same? Would an Indiana jury side with the company that refused service to a couple because of their sexual orientation? In a letter expressing concern about the Indiana law, a group of 30 legal scholars argued that what Indiana has done is expanded the scope of the law to the point that religious considerations might trump discrimination concerns. \"In our expert opinion, the clear evidence ... unmistakably demonstrates that the broad language of the proposed state RFRA will more likely create confusion, conflict, and a wave of litigation that will threaten the clarity of religious liberty rights in Indiana while undermining the state's ability to enforce other compelling interests,\" the letter, whose signatories included many Indiana law professors, stated. These concerns are based on speculation of what might happen, said Josh Blackman, a constitutional law professor at South Texas College of Law. Yes, the Indiana law makes it clear that individuals and private companies can use the religious freedom law as a defense, he said. \"But, just because you raise the defense does not mean it will be successful.\" Those who try to defend their discriminatory actions in court tend to lose, Blackman said. In his opinion, if Elane Photography had been able to use the law as a defense in New Mexico, it still likely would have lost the case. What's clear is that Indiana's law increases the potential pool of people who can defend themselves claiming religious freedom. The success of such arguments is to be seen. In the meantime, some are already hatching plans on how to test the law, including Bill Levin, founder of The First Church Of Cannabis, who argued on CNN that the law should protect his right to smoke pot. Much is being made of the fact that the first religious freedom law was signed by President Bill Clinton more than 20  years ago. There was bipartisan support in 1993, so why the commotion over a similar law in 2015, some ask? Context, timing and intent have changed the way these laws are viewed. The federal law was written by two Democrats, Schumer and the late Sen. Edward Kennedy. Today, it is being championed by Republicans. The law came into being after two Native Americans in Oregon were fired from their jobs at a rehab clinic because they had consumed peyote, the hallucinogenic cactus. They were denied unemployment benefits, and they sued the state, claiming that the peyote was part of their religious customs. They lost the case. There was outrage over the decision, and the law was created as a remedy. As envisioned by its authors, it would protect the freedoms of religious minorities. Over the years, the law helped a number of people -- a Muslim prisoner won the right to grow a short beard, a Santeria priest was allowed to sacrifice a goat on special religious occasions, and a Native American boy received an exception to his school's policy banning long hair on boys. The law was on the books for years, with little attention paid to it. But Holbrook says it is no coincidence that the religious freedom laws became popular at the state level just as the gay rights and marriage equality movement made historic steps. Many states are using the laws to carve out exceptions to allow Christians to deny services to same-sex couples. Holbrook said. \"The timing is beyond a coincidence,\" he said. \"We are having an interest in RFRA at the time same-sex marriage is coming forward.\" Though not enshrined in the law, critics accuse the states pursuing the laws of using them to justify discrimination by the majority religion. Blackman said the history of the state religious freedom laws shows that they have not turned into conduits for discrimination. The expanded laws might mean more people will defend themselves using it, but most will likely lose, he said. \"The moral outrage over this reflects how uninformed people are on the history of the RFRA,\" he said. So we've established that the biggest difference between the federal law and the Indiana law is the scope: In Indiana, the law can be raised as a defense in private disputes, while the federal law applies only to government matters. Not so fast. According to Blackman, the interpretations of the federal religious freedom law are not uniform. Four U.S. circuit courts of appeals have ruled that the federal law can be used as a defense in cases involving private parties. Two other appeals courts have ruled that this is not allowed. And then, there is the Hobby Lobby case. Hobby Lobby, citing the federal religious freedom law, argued that it should not have to provide contraception coverage through insurance to its employees via Obamacare because it was against the owners' beliefs. And, Hobby Lobby won the case before the Supreme Court. The ruling, in effect, expanded the reach of the federal law to include a business. The Hobby Lobby decision, plus the appeals courts rulings, may have opened the door for states like Indiana to be explicit about its expansion of the law. One way to look at it, Blackman said, is that Indiana simply clarified and codified something that is hazy in the federal courts. The outrage over the Indiana law is that it can be used to deny services to the LGBT community on the ground of religious beliefs. Some may rightfully ask, \"Where was the outrage before the religious freedom law?\" Indiana does not have an nondiscrimination law that protects people based on sexual orientation or gender identity. In that sense, the religious freedom law is not necessary for those who want to discriminate against gays and lesbians. Even before the controversial Indiana law was passed, if a restaurant denied service to a gay couple, the couple might be able to sue, but not for discrimination. For that matter, there is also no federal law that protects the LGBT community. According to the Human Rights Campaign, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people are sometimes fired, denied a promotion or harassed in the workplace. And their recourse is limited. With the proliferation of religious freedom state laws, nondiscrimination laws become even more important. Another hypothetical outcome of the New Mexico case involving the lesbian couple and the photography studio. If New Mexico had the same religious freedom law as Indiana, the case would have gone to trial. But New Mexico has a nondiscrimination law that protects the LGBT community, it and it would have provided a strong counter-argument to the religious freedom claim. In Indiana, that protection would be lacking. (It gets more complicated when some local governments, like the city of Indianapolis, do have nondiscrimination ordinances). For this reason, Holbrook suggests that a \"fix\" for the Indiana law would be the passage of a nondiscrimination law. Or, at the very least, an exception written into the religious freedom bill that protects from such discrimination.", "annotations": [{"summary_1": "Indiana's religious freedom law has sparked a fierce debate.
